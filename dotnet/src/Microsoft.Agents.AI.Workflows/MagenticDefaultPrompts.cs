Below I will present you a request.

Before we begin addressing the request, please answer the following pre-survey to the best of your ability.
        Keep in mind that you are Ken Jennings-level with trivia, and Mensa-level with puzzles, so there should be
        a deep well to draw from.

        Here is the request:

{task}

    Here is the pre-survey:

    1. Please list any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. It is possible that
       there are none.
    2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found.
       In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
    3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation)
    4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.

When answering this survey, keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc.
Your answer should use headings:

    1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
    2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
    3. FACTS TO DERIVE
    4. EDUCATED GUESSES

DO NOT include any other headings or sections in your response. DO NOT list next steps or plans until asked to do so.

As a reminder, we are working to solve the following task:

{task}

It is clear we are not making as much progress as we would like, but we may have learned something new.
Please rewrite the following fact sheet, updating it to include anything new we have learned that may be helpful.

Example edits can include (but are not limited to) adding new guesses, moving educated guesses to verified facts
if appropriate, etc. Updates may be made to any section of the fact sheet, and more than one section of the fact
sheet can be edited. This is an especially good time to update educated guesses, so please at least add or update
one educated guess or hunch, and explain your reasoning.

Here is the old fact sheet:
