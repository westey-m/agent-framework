Sample: Azure AI Agents in a Workflow with Streaming

This sample shows how to create agents backed by Azure OpenAI Responses and use them in a workflow with streaming.

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME must be set to your Azure OpenAI model deployment name.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, edges, events, and streaming runs.
