"""Background Responses Sample.

This sample demonstrates long-running agent operations using the OpenAI
Responses API ``background`` option.  Two patterns are shown:

1. **Non-streaming polling** – start a background run, then poll with the
   ``continuation_token`` until the operation completes.
2. **Streaming with resumption** – start a background streaming run, simulate
   an interruption, and resume from the last ``continuation_token``.

Prerequisites:
  - Set the ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` environment variable.
  - A model that benefits from background execution (e.g. ``o3``).

Sample output:

=== Non-Streaming Polling ===

Initial status: continuation_token=set
  Poll 1: continuation_token=set
  Poll 2: continuation_token=None

Result (2 poll(s)):
The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of special
relativity (1905), which shows that the laws of physics are the same for all
non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light is constant, and general
relativity (1915), which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused
by mass and energy.

=== Streaming with Resumption ===

First stream (before interruption):
Here are three
  [simulated interruption]
Resumed stream:
key benefits of regular exercise:

1. **Improved cardiovascular health** ...
2. **Better mental health** ...
3. **Stronger muscles and bones** ...
