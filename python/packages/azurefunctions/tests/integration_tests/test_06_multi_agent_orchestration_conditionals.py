Integration Tests for MultiAgent Conditionals Sample

Tests the multi-agent conditionals sample for conditional orchestration logic.

The function app is automatically started by the test fixture.

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI credentials configured (see packages/azurefunctions/tests/integration_tests/.env.example)
- Azurite running for durable orchestrations (or Azure Storage account configured)

Usage:
    # Start Azurite (if not already running)
    azurite &

    # Run tests
    uv run pytest packages/azurefunctions/tests/integration_tests/test_06_multi_agent_orchestration_conditionals.py -v
