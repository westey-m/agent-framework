"""Responses-only hosting sample that serves a harness agent.

This sample is the sibling of ``local_responses/``. It keeps the exact same
helper-first hosting shape but swaps the plain ``Agent`` target for a
batteries-included harness agent built with ``create_harness_agent``:

1. ``create_harness_agent`` (from core ``agent-framework``) assembles the full
   agent pipeline from a chat client: the function-invocation loop,
   per-service-call history persistence, context-window compaction, a todo
   provider, and heuristic tool approval.
2. ``agent-framework-hosting-responses`` converts Responses request/response
   payloads to and from Agent Framework run values.
3. ``agent-framework-hosting`` owns shared execution state via ``AgentState``
   and its ``SessionStore``.
4. FastAPI owns the route, request parsing, policy decisions, and response
   object.

The point of the sample is that a harness agent is just an ``Agent``, so it
drops straight into the same ``AgentState`` / Responses-helper seam as any
other target. The interactive-only harness features (plan/execute mode and the
Textual console) are turned off because a one-shot HTTP request has no console
to drive; web search is turned off to keep the sample self-contained. Todo
management and compaction stay on so the target is a genuine harness agent and
not just a relabelled plain ``Agent``.

Because the server runs headless, the ``lookup_weather`` tool is registered
with ``approval_mode="never_require"`` so a run never blocks waiting for a human
to approve a tool call.

Production readiness
---
This sample is not a full-fledged production deployment. Before exposing this
route to callers, add authentication and authorization at the infrastructure
layer, the FastAPI app layer, or inside the route body.

Session continuation deserves particular care: treat ``previous_response_id``
and ``conversation`` as untrusted request values, authorize the caller
before loading or storing a session for those ids, and partition durable session
storage by tenant/user as appropriate for your application. See
``README.md#production-readiness``.

Unknown ids supplied through ``conversation`` create a new local session in this sample.
Your app can choose a different policy, such as requiring a separate API to
create new conversations before callers can continue them.

Environment variables:
    FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT — Azure AI Foundry project endpoint URL
    FOUNDRY_MODEL            — Model deployment name

Run
---
``app`` is a module-level FastAPI ASGI app. Recommended local launch::

    uv sync
    az login
    export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://<your-project>.services.ai.azure.com
    export FOUNDRY_MODEL=gpt-5-nano
    uv run hypercorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

Or use the ``__main__`` block (single-process Hypercorn) for quick
iteration::

    uv run python app.py

Then call it::

    uv run python call_server.py
