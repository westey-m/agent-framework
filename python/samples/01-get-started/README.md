# Get Started with Agent Framework for Python

This folder contains a progressive set of samples that introduce the core
concepts of **Agent Framework** one step at a time.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install agent-framework-foundry azure-identity
az login
```

All samples hardcode example values for `project_endpoint` and `model`. Replace them with your Microsoft
Foundry project endpoint and model deployment name before running the sample.

Alternatively, set `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `FOUNDRY_MODEL`, then remove the `project_endpoint` and `model`
arguments from the `FoundryChatClient` constructor. To read those values from a `.env` file, call `load_dotenv()`
before creating the client; Agent Framework doesn't load `.env` files automatically.

## Samples

| # | File | What you'll learn |
|---|------|-------------------|
| 1 | [01_hello_agent.py](01_hello_agent.py) | Create your first agent and run one request. |
| 2 | [02_add_tools.py](02_add_tools.py) | Define a function tool with `@tool` and attach it to an agent. |
| 3 | [03_multi_turn.py](03_multi_turn.py) | Reuse an agent session to keep conversation history across turns. |
| 4 | [04_memory.py](04_memory.py) | Store and inject session state with a custom `ContextProvider`. |
| 5a | [05a_functional_workflow_basics.py](05a_functional_workflow_basics.py) | Write a workflow as a plain async function. |
| 5b | [05b_functional_workflow_with_agents.py](05b_functional_workflow_with_agents.py) | Call agents inside a functional workflow. |
| 5c | [05c_first_graph_workflow.py](05c_first_graph_workflow.py) | Connect function executors with a graph edge. |
| 6 | [06_agent_harness.py](06_agent_harness.py) | Add planning, todo tracking, and compaction with an agent harness. |
| 7 | [07_hosting.py](07_hosting.py) | Serve an agent with `ResponsesHostServer`. |

For more hosting patterns, continue with [`04-hosting/`](../04-hosting/). Durable Task and Azure Functions samples
are in the [Durable Agent Framework extension](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/tree/main/python/samples).

## Security in Production

Introductory tutorials in this directory demonstrate core agent mechanics with minimal wiring. When building agents for production that handle untrusted external content (emails, user attachments, web browsing, third-party APIs) or execute privileged actions, incorporate security controls against indirect prompt injection and data exfiltration.

For the official security guidance, see [Agent Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/concepts/agents/safety) on Microsoft Learn. Then see [`samples/02-agents/security/`](../02-agents/security/) for production-ready security patterns:

1. [`email_security_example.py`](../02-agents/security/email_security_example.py): Demonstrates `SecureAgentConfig`, isolated execution using `quarantined_llm`, and approval gating before invoking sensitive tools.
2. [`repo_confidentiality_example.py`](../02-agents/security/repo_confidentiality_example.py): Demonstrates tracking data confidentiality to prevent sensitive data leaks.
3. [`github_mcp_example.py`](../02-agents/security/github_mcp_example.py): Demonstrates `SecureMCPToolProxy` wrapping remote MCP endpoints with local policy enforcement.
4. [FIDES Developer Guide](../02-agents/security/FIDES_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md): Architecture reference and security middleware documentation.

Run samples 1 through 6 with:

```bash
python 01_hello_agent.py
```

Run the PEP 723 hosting sample from the repository root with:

```bash
uv run python/samples/01-get-started/07_hosting.py
```

These samples use Microsoft Foundry models with the Responses API. To switch providers, replace the client. See
[all providers](../02-agents/providers/README.md).
