// Hosts the claw as a Foundry Hosted Agent (Responses API).
//
// Observability requires no extra wiring here: AddFoundryResponses automatically wraps the agent
// with OpenTelemetryAgent, and the Foundry hosting runtime (Azure.AI.AgentServer.Core's
// AddAgentHostTelemetry) registers the OTLP exporter pipeline. In the hosted environment Foundry
// injects APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING automatically, so traces, metrics and logs flow to
// Application Insights with no exporter configuration. To capture prompt/response content in traces,
// set OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=true (off by default).
//
// File access and shell are DISABLED on the hosted agent. Granting the model arbitrary read/write
// access to the container filesystem, or letting it run shell commands, is a serious security risk in
// a shared hosted environment (data exfiltration, tampering, persistence) — and the local
// confirmations vault the shell operates on does not exist here. If you genuinely need file access
// when hosted, supply an external AgentFileStore (for example, one backed by Azure Blob Storage) via
// ClawAgentFactoryOptions.FileStore instead of using the container disk.
//
// CodeAct uses LocalCodeAct here, NOT the Hyperlight provider the local hosts use. Hyperlight runs
// guest code in a VM-isolated micro-sandbox that needs a hypervisor (KVM) and FUSE — neither of which
// an unprivileged Foundry hosted container exposes (attempting it fails at startup while configuring
// `fuse`, so the app never reports ready). LocalCodeAct instead runs the generated Python in a child
// process and relies on the hosted container itself as the isolation boundary, which is exactly the
// pattern the canonical Hosted-LocalCodeAct sample uses. SECURITY: LocalCodeAct is not itself a
// sandbox — only deploy it to an externally sandboxed environment such as a Foundry hosted-agent
// container.
