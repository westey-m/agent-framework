# Feature-usage bitmask in the User-Agent

## Context and Problem Statement

We can see which Agent Framework packages are installed and that *some* framework
call happened (via the existing `agent-framework-python/{version}` User-Agent),
but we have no usage-based signal about **which features are actually exercised**
at runtime, nor which are used *together* (e.g. workflows + MCP + Foundry). How
can we collect a lightweight, privacy-respecting signal of feature usage for the
traffic we can actually read, without standing up new event pipelines?

The detailed mechanism is in [SPEC-004](../specs/004-feature-usage-telemetry.md);
the per-language bit tables are in
[feature-usage-bit-registry.md](../specs/feature-usage-bit-registry.md).

## Decision Drivers

- **Transparency** — openly documented, human-decodable, user-controllable. No
  hidden or obfuscated telemetry.
- **First-party scope / no third-party leakage** — emission requires both an
  explicitly approved client/pipeline family and an approved actual HTTPS origin
  on every request (including redirects). Credentials or an Azure setting alone
  never approve a custom gateway/origin.
- **Live signal** — read the process's observed-feature set *so far* at request
  send time, rather than freezing it at client construction.
- **Low cost / few moving parts** — reuse telemetry already in the request path;
  bounded fixed-width processing; as little machinery as the job needs.
- **Privacy** — encode only coarse "observed at least once" Boolean feature
  state, never counts; no identifiers, arguments, prompts, payloads,
  model/deployment names, endpoints, or customer-defined names.
- **Use, not presence** — package-level indexes mean a capability reached its
  first meaningful activation, not that a package was installed/imported or a
  DI container constructed an unused service.
- **Versioning discipline** — v1 is a point-in-time decision. Adding bits later is
  easier than removing or redefining them, so the initial table should lean toward
  fewer bits and avoid forcing v2 shortly after launch.
- **Allocation discipline** — each bit represents a stable framework-owned
  capability with a concrete product/support question and an actual-use mark
  point; implementation detail and speculative distinctions stay out.

## Considered Options

The options below are grouped by the decisions that matter: the **transport**,
the **granularity**, and the **registry sharing model**.

### Transport

#### A. User-Agent token, first-party only, per request (chosen)

Stamp a `(feat=...)` comment onto the UA, but only on approved Azure/Foundry
client pipelines, and re-evaluate it per request.

- Good, reuses telemetry already sent to approved backends we can read.
- Good, request-time stamping reflects the live mask (not frozen at construction).
- Good, first-party scoping means no fingerprint leaks to third-party providers.
- Good, two-factor destination approval (pipeline + actual origin) denies custom
  `base_url` gateways and strips the token on unapproved redirect hops.
- Good, maps onto .NET's existing per-request UA pipeline policies unchanged.
- Neutral, v1 stamps only pipelines the framework creates or can configure
  through supported public hooks. It does not mutate caller-owned clients or
  reach into private SDK pipelines.
- Bad, no signal for traffic that never hits a first-party endpoint (accepted —
  we couldn't read it anyway).

#### B. User-Agent token on all clients

- Good, simplest to wire (one static header).
- Bad, sends a deployment fingerprint to OpenAI/Anthropic/AWS/Google logs we
  cannot read — privacy leak for zero benefit.
- Bad, baked into static `default_headers`, so it freezes at client construction
  and reports a near-empty mask.

#### C. OpenTelemetry span/resource attribute

- Good, precise per-call usage; no UA change.
- Bad (**privacy — the main reason to hold it**), a span attribute broadcasts the
  feature-combination fingerprint into the user's **general** telemetry pipeline,
  which is typically exported to third-party APM vendors (Datadog, Honeycomb, …).
  That re-introduces exactly the fingerprint leakage the first-party-only UA
  scoping (A) was chosen to avoid — just into a different set of third parties.
- Bad (secondary), also a cardinality footgun (a growing, combinatorial value
  must never become a metric dimension).
- Neutral, for the team's own goal it reaches us only if the user exports to
  Azure Monitor and we query it.
- **Deferred, not rejected.** The version prefix lets us add it later **if** the
  User-Agent path cannot answer a concrete query and there is an acceptable
  scoped/redacted variant.

#### D. Bespoke usage events

- Good, richest detail and flexibility.
- Bad, new data flow and cost; larger privacy surface; heavy to build and review;
  overkill for a coarse "which features" signal.

#### E. Install/import-time signal only (status quo-ish)

- Good, zero new runtime work.
- Bad, measures installation, not usage; cannot capture feature combinations —
  does not solve the problem.

### Accumulation scope

#### S1. Process-global, monotonic mask (chosen)

A single mask per process; bits are OR-ed in as features are first used and never
cleared. The token reflects "what this process has used so far."

- **Binary interpretation:** a set bit means the feature was observed at least
  once in this process before the request was sent. A bit repeated on later
  requests is the same Boolean observation, not another feature use. It cannot be
  summed into invocation, request, agent, user, or tenant counts.
- Good, fits our **mixed feature lifecycle**: many features are *not* bound to an
  outbound service request — an agent/workflow may first run or build, a
  context/history provider may first participate in a session, and a host may
  start serving before the request that later emits the token. A process-wide
  mask can carry those activations forward.
- Good, trivial and cheap: one OR under a lock (Python) / one atomic OR into one
  of two 64-bit lanes (.NET); no per-request state plumbing.
- Good, deliberately coarse for privacy: it avoids emitting a sequence of exact
  per-call feature combinations that could reconstruct a workload's behavioral
  trace.
- Neutral, coarser than per-call — early requests carry fewer bits than later
  ones, and the token says "this process used X", not "this call used X" or "X
  was used this many times."

For example, at time 1 Agent A can use MCP and a Foundry chat client. At time 2,
Agent B in the same worker can make a normal Foundry chat call without MCP. The
time-2 request still carries the MCP bit because MCP was previously observed in
that process. It does **not** say Agent B used MCP, nor count a second MCP use.

#### S2. Per-request set, reset between calls (botocore's model — rejected)

AWS botocore scopes its `m/` feature codes to a `contextvars` set that is reset
between requests, giving exact per-call attribution (and it deliberately no-ops
when called outside a request context to avoid features bleeding across requests).
See [Prior art](#prior-art).

- Good, exact per-call attribution directly in the User-Agent.
- Bad, **assumes every feature is exercised inside a single service request** —
  true for botocore (an SDK natively bound to AWS service calls), but *not* for
  us. Our features split into request-scoped ones (a chat call, an MCP tool
  invocation) and decidedly non-request ones (workflow build/start, provider
  participation, hosting startup). The latter have no service request to attach to, so a
  per-request set would simply miss them.
- Bad, needs `contextvars` propagation through every async/threaded path and a
  reset discipline, plus enable/disable calls around every scoped operation; the
  bleed-guard botocore documents is the warning sign.
- Bad, creates a more detailed per-call behavioral trace, increasing the privacy
  sensitivity and review burden compared with a coarse process-lifetime Boolean.
- Note, per-call attribution for the request-scoped subset is better served by
  the deferred OTel span path (option C) than by reshaping the UA token.

### Granularity

The mechanism can support several granularities. The remaining decision before
implementation is how detailed v1 should be. The estimates below are
intentionally rough; v1 uses a fixed 128-bit bound to leave useful headroom
without making the registry unbounded.

#### F0. Package-level bits

One bit per package, set on first use of a package-owned public API, client,
provider, or tool. It is **not** set on install, import, or assembly load.

Examples that get bits:

- `agent-framework-core` when `Agent`, `AgentSession`, `Workflow`, etc. is used.
- `agent-framework-tools` when a `LocalShellTool` or `DockerShellTool` first
  executes/probes its shell capability.
- `agent-framework-foundry` when a `FoundryChatClient`, `FoundryAgent`, etc.
  performs its first Foundry operation.
- `agent-framework-openai` when `OpenAIChatClient`,
  `OpenAIEmbeddingClient`, etc. performs its first provider operation.
- `agent-framework-azure-ai-search` when `AzureAISearchContextProvider` is used.
- `agent-framework-azure-cosmos` when `CosmosHistoryProvider` is used.
- `agent-framework-redis` when `RedisContextProvider` or `RedisHistoryProvider`
  is used.

Examples that do **not** get separate bits: merely installed dependencies;
imports or DI construction with no activation; `Agent` vs `AgentSession` vs
`InMemoryHistoryProvider`; `FunctionTool` vs `MCPStdioTool` vs `LocalShellTool`
vs `DockerShellTool`; `FoundryChatClient` vs `FoundryAgent`; `OpenAIChatClient`
vs `OpenAIEmbeddingClient`.

Rough estimate: Python ~25-35 bits; .NET ~15-25 bits.

- Good, lowest specificity and simplest registry.
- Good, clearly measures usage rather than dependency inventory if bits are set
  only at package-owned public API/client/provider/tool use sites.
- Bad, does not answer which major capability within a package is used.

#### F1. Package + major capability bits

Package bits plus selected major capabilities that are product-distinct and stable
across implementations.

Examples that get bits:

- `agent-framework-core` plus `Agent`.
- `AgentSession` plus `InMemoryHistoryProvider` / `FileHistoryProvider` as one
  history capability.
- `Workflow` / `FunctionalWorkflow` as one workflow capability.
- `FunctionTool`; MCP transports as one MCP capability; shell tools as one shell
  capability.
- Skills provider plus stable source types: file, in-memory/programmatic, and
  MCP-backed skills (with .NET inline/class skill distinctions).
- Foundry chat/agent/embedding capabilities; OpenAI chat/embedding capabilities.

Examples that do **not** get separate bits: `InMemoryHistoryProvider` vs
`FileHistoryProvider`; `WorkflowBuilder`, `AgentExecutor`, `FunctionExecutor`, or
`FanOutEdgeGroup`; `MCPStdioTool` vs `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` vs
`MCPWebsocketTool`; `LocalShellTool` vs `DockerShellTool` vs
`ShellEnvironmentProvider` vs `ShellPolicy`; `OpenAIChatClient` vs
`OpenAIChatCompletionClient`; skill-source decorators such as caching, filtering,
deduplication, and aggregation.

Rough estimate: Python ~60-70 indexes; .NET ~45-55 indexes. The current candidate
registry is at 63 Python / 52 .NET assigned indexes.

- Good, likely answers the first product adoption questions while staying compact.
- Good, fits comfortably within 128 bits while leaving room for additive package
  and feature growth.
- Neutral, some provider internals remain collapsed until a later additive bit is
  justified.

#### F2. Public construct / concrete type bits

One bit per public construct that users intentionally instantiate or configure.

Examples that get bits:

- `Agent`, `AgentSession`, `InMemoryHistoryProvider`, `FileHistoryProvider`.
- `Workflow`, `WorkflowBuilder`, `FunctionalWorkflow`.
- `FunctionTool`, `MCPStdioTool`, `MCPStreamableHTTPTool`, `MCPWebsocketTool`.
- `LocalShellTool`, `DockerShellTool`, `ShellEnvironmentProvider`, `ShellPolicy`.
- `FoundryChatClient`, `FoundryAgent`, `OpenAIChatClient`,
  `OpenAIChatCompletionClient`, `OpenAIEmbeddingClient`.

Examples that do **not** get separate bits: `Agent.run` vs
`Agent.run_streamed`; workflow edge/executor internals such as `AgentExecutor`,
`FunctionExecutor`, or `FanOutEdgeGroup`; `LocalShellTool` persistent vs
stateless mode; `ShellPolicy` allowlist vs denylist configuration; `FunctionTool`
approval mode or result parser choices.

Rough estimate: Python ~70-100 bits; .NET ~55-80 bits.

- Good, concrete and directly tied to public API use.
- Neutral, fits within 128 bits at the current estimate, but consumes much of the
  deliberate growth reserve.
- Bad, adds many call sites and more fingerprint specificity for v1.

#### F3. Construct subtype / configuration bits

Split important constructs by mode, transport, storage, or workflow primitive
when that distinction matters.

Examples that get bits:

- `InMemoryHistoryProvider` and `FileHistoryProvider` separately.
- `FunctionalWorkflow`, `WorkflowBuilder`, `AgentExecutor`, `FunctionExecutor`.
- `FanOutEdgeGroup`, `FanInEdgeGroup`, `SwitchCaseEdgeGroup`.
- `LocalShellTool` persistent, `LocalShellTool` stateless, `DockerShellTool`.
- `MCPStdioTool`, `MCPStreamableHTTPTool`, `MCPWebsocketTool`;
  `OpenAIChatClient` vs `OpenAIChatCompletionClient`.

Examples that do **not** get separate bits: exact session id or persisted history
file path; exact shell command, workdir, timeout, or output cap; exact MCP server
command, URL, or tool names from the server; exact workflow graph shape or edge
count; model/deployment names, prompts, tool arguments, payloads.

Rough estimate: Python ~110-150 bits; .NET ~85-125 bits.

- Good, useful where mode-level distinctions are decision-relevant.
- Bad, trades simplicity for precision, increases fingerprint specificity, and
  may exhaust or exceed 128 bits in Python.

#### F4. Option / behavior flag bits

The most detailed framework-owned option: bits for specific modes and behavior
switches, still excluding customer/runtime values.

Examples that get bits:

- Agent streaming used vs non-streaming used.
- `FunctionTool` `approval_mode="always_require"` vs `"never_require"`.
- `FunctionTool` `SKIP_PARSING` / result-parser path used.
- MCP sampling configured; MCP long-running task support used.
- `LocalShellTool` `clean_env` / `confine_workdir`; `DockerShellTool` container
  mode.

Examples that do **not** get separate bits: function names wrapped by
`FunctionTool`; approval rule arguments or approval decisions; MCP remote tool
names or schemas; shell command text or policy regex patterns; prompt/message
content, model names, URLs, tenant/user/session identifiers.

Rough estimate: Python 150+ bits; .NET 120+ bits.

- Good, maximum framework-owned detail.
- Bad, exceeds or nearly exhausts 128 bits and is too detailed for v1 without a
  concrete decision that requires it.

### Registry sharing model

#### H. Per-language bit lists (chosen)

Each SDK owns an independent list; the decoder picks the list using the language
already present in the UA product token.

- Good, **no cross-language coordination**: each SDK numbers and evolves its
  features independently; adding a Python feature never touches .NET numbering.
- Good, no null placeholders for one-SDK features, no "same bit, same meaning"
  rule, no SDK-aware decode caveats.
- Good, decoding is trivial: language (from UA) + version -> list -> AND.
- Neutral, two small lists to maintain instead of one (but they were going to
  diverge anyway — the packages differ).

#### I. Single shared cross-language registry

- Good, one list, one number space.
- Bad, forces synchronized numbering and null placeholders for features that
  exist in only one SDK, plus SDK-aware decode rules.
- Bad, the synchronization is pure accidental complexity — **the language is
  already in the User-Agent**, so sharing the number space buys nothing.

### Registry maintenance

#### J. Package-local indexes + parity/no-overlap test (chosen)

- Good, each package owns private `FeatureIndex` declarations only for its own
  rows; adding an optional-provider index does not require a core release after
  the marker API exists.
- Good, one repository test compares the package-local declarations with the
  per-language table and rejects missing rows, wrong ids, out-of-range indexes,
  and any duplicate/overlapping index.
- Good, no build step, no generator to own.

#### K. Code-generate the enums from the registry

- Bad, a generator + drift test + schema test to maintain a short list of
  integer constants; likely justified only if v1 deliberately chooses the most
  detailed L3/L4 granularities.

### Representation (how the mask is rendered as text)

All examples below encode the same mask — bits 0, 2, 32, 48, 56 set
(agent + workflow + sequential-orchestration + foundry.chat_client + openai, in
the Python v1 list) = decimal `72339073309605893`.

#### L. Decimal — `feat=v1.72339073309605893`

- Good, human-familiar; trivial to parse.
- Neutral, no visual alignment to four-bit groups; slightly longer than hex for
  large masks. No advantage over hex.

#### M. Hex (chosen) — `feat=v1.101000100000005`

- Good, compact (≤32 chars for a 128-bit mask).
- Good, decodes with one stdlib call in every language (`int(x, 16)` /
  two 64-bit lane parses in .NET); each hex character corresponds to four
  consecutive bit positions.
- Good, lowercase, no `0x` prefix, no leading zeros — unambiguous and stable.

A grouped variant such as `feat=v1.101.0001.0000.0005` was also considered.
Separators make the value longer and must be removed before `int(x, 16)` can
parse it, while the ordinary hex digits already preserve fixed four-bit groups.

#### N. Binary — `feat=v1.100000001000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000101`

- Good, directly shows every zero/one position.
- Bad, grows to 128 payload characters and is difficult to scan reliably.

#### O. Bit-list — `feat=v1.0,2,32,48,56`

- Good, most directly human-readable ("which bits").
- Bad, needs delimiter handling and grows with the number of set bits; a full
  128-bit list is substantially larger than every fixed-width representation.

#### P. Alphabet / base-N (e.g. Crockford base32 `feat=v1.208004000005`, base62 `feat=v1.5LJRx1i6xJ`)

- Good, shortest representation.
- Bad, needs a custom alphabet + decode table on both ends; base62 is
  case-sensitive (fragile through case-normalizing intermediaries); not
  directly readable. Premature optimization for a value that is already ≤32
  chars in hex.

All forms are ASCII. The table shows total bytes added to the existing
User-Agent, including the leading space and `(feat=v1.)` wrapper:

| Representation | Example (5 bits) | All current Python rows (63) | All current .NET rows (52) | Full 128-bit v1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Hex | 26 | 34 | 30 | 43 |
| Grouped hex | 29 | 39 | 34 | 50 |
| Decimal | 28 | 38 | 34 | 50 |
| Binary | 68 | 100 | 86 | 139 |
| Bit-list | 23 | 189 | 156 | 412 |
| Crockford base32 | 23 | 29 | 26 | 37 |
| Base62 | 21 | 26 | 24 | 33 |

There is no defensible average before rollout, and the design does not depend on
one: a process-global mask may eventually contain every assigned row. There is
no smaller per-request bit budget because the bits are not request-scoped; the
registry allocation tenet controls how many distinctions v1 assigns. Client
processing is bounded by the fixed 128-bit width: marking performs one
lock/atomic OR, and request-time stamping reads the mask, formats at most 32 hex
characters, and replaces one User-Agent comment. It performs no registry scan,
network call, or per-feature enable/disable bookkeeping.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: **a request-time-stamped, first-party-only User-Agent `(feat=...)` token (A),
with a 128-bit process-global monotonic accumulator (S1), per-language bit lists
(H), package-local index enums kept honest by parity and no-overlap tests (J),
rendered as lowercase hex (M).**

This is a bounded design with enough v1 headroom. A 128-bit
**process-global, monotonic** mask accumulates from universal
`mark_feature_used()` calls (so it spans build/start/participation activations
that aren't bound to any service request — the per-request set model (S2) can't);
the token is **stamped per request** only when both the client/pipeline and the
actual HTTPS origin are approved, so custom origins and cross-origin redirects
cannot inherit the fingerprint; each
SDK owns an independent bit list selected by the language already in the UA; the
mask is rendered as hex (`feat=v1.101000100000005`). The dedicated
`AGENT_FRAMEWORK_FEATURE_MASK_DISABLED` opt-out drops only the mask while
keeping the base SDK identity/version User-Agent. Python's existing
`AGENT_FRAMEWORK_USER_AGENT_DISABLED` continues to suppress its entire
contribution, including the mask; this decision does not introduce a matching
whole-User-Agent switch in .NET. OTel (C) is deferred — mainly because a
broadly-emitted span attribute would leak the fingerprint into the user's
general telemetry, against the first-party-only stance and would require
user-side OTel setup that may still not make the data available to us — but left
open behind the version prefix. Per-request scoping (S2), a shared registry (I),
codegen for the initial registry (K), and the decimal/grouped-hex/binary/bit-list/
base-N representations (L, M variant, N, O, P) are rejected as complexity or
length the problem does not require.

The remaining choice before implementation is the **v1 granularity level** among
F0-F4. This is a point-in-time decision: adding new bits later is easier than
removing or redefining them, because removals/redefinitions require a new
registry version and historical decode tables. For v1, prefer the least detailed
level that answers the known product/support questions so we do not force a v2
shortly after launch. The refreshed candidate registry uses **63 Python indexes and
52 .NET indexes**, leaving 65 and 76 positions respectively. That headroom supports
normal growth; it does not waive the registry's
[allocation tenet](../specs/feature-usage-bit-registry.md#allocation-tenet).

### Consequences

- Good, adds a bounded-cost usage signal with no new data flow and few moving
  parts.
- Good, transparent (public registry, human-decodable token) and disabled by a
  dedicated `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_FEATURE_MASK_DISABLED` mask-only opt-out. Python's
  existing whole-User-Agent opt-out also suppresses the mask.
- Good, first-party-only + request-time stamping gives a live mask and no
  third-party fingerprint leak.
- Good, 128 bits leaves useful v1 headroom; .NET remains lock-free by storing two
  independently atomic 64-bit lanes; per-language lists remove all cross-language
  sync; package-local enums avoid both codegen and provider→core release coupling.
- Neutral, the token's reach equals eligible framework-configured first-party
  traffic; broader per-call signal (OTel) can be added later if needed.
- Neutral, every set bit is a repeated Boolean observation after first use;
  request rows carrying it are not feature invocation counts.
- Neutral, v1 granularity is intentionally a separate choice; the registry should
  start with fewer bits unless a more detailed bit answers a concrete question.
- Bad, each feature must add an activation mark, first-party clients need a
  per-request destination-aware hook, and the registry validator must scan all
  package-local index declarations.

## Prior art

SDK telemetry-in-the-User-Agent is well-established; this design is closest to
AWS's, and conventional in the rest. Summary of what comparable SDKs do:

| SDK | What's in the UA / headers | Usage-based? | Opt-out | Closest to ours? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AWS botocore** | structured UA with an `m/` token: a per-request set of **short feature codes** for features actually exercised (`WAITER`→`B`, `PAGINATOR`→`C`, retry mode, checksums, credential source, …) | **Yes** — registered at call time via `register_feature_id`, contextvar-scoped per request | `AWS_SDK_UA_APP_ID` sets app id (no opt-out for `m/`) | **Yes — direct analog** |
| **OpenAI / Anthropic** (Stainless) | sidecar `X-Stainless-*` headers: lang, package version, OS, arch, runtime, runtime version; plus per-request `x-stainless-retry-count`, `x-stainless-read-timeout` | Mostly static identity (retry/timeout are per-request) | none | No (static identity) |
| **Azure SDK** (`azure-core`) | `User-Agent: azsdk-python-{pkg}/{ver} Python/{pyver} ({platform})` | No | `AZURE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` (tracing spans only, **not** the UA) | No |
| **Google API core** | `x-goog-api-client: gl-python/… grpc/… gax/… gapic/…` | No | none | No |
| **LangSmith** | `User-Agent: langsmith-py/{ver}`; usage lives in trace payloads | No (header) | opt-in via `LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2`/`LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`; `…HIDE_INPUTS/OUTPUTS` | No |

Takeaways that shaped (or validate) our choices:

- **AWS `m/` is the precedent for usage-based feature flags in a first-party
  User-Agent.** It validates the core idea. Its key *difference* is the encoding:
  AWS uses a **comma-separated set of 1–2 char short codes** (open-ended, no bit
  coordination, but variable length), whereas we use a fixed-width **hex
  bitmask** (compact, bounded, decode-by-AND, but needs per-language bit
  allocation). We keep the bitmask for boundedness and trivial AND-decoding;
  AWS's short-code set is recorded as a viable alternative if bit-position
  coordination ever becomes painful (it would also drop the fixed 128-bit bound).
- **A fixed-width bitmask gives bounded token size for free.** botocore must cap
  the `m/` component at 1024 bytes and truncate at delimiter boundaries (with a
  fallback log) precisely *because* its short-code set is unbounded. Our 128-bit
  hex is ≤32 chars by construction — no size cap, no truncation logic.
- **Scope is where we diverge most — and deliberately.** botocore collects
  features into a per-request `contextvars` set that is **reset between
  requests**, and no-ops outside a request context to prevent cross-request
  bleed. That works because every botocore feature is exercised *inside* an AWS
  service request. We are more general: some features are request-scoped (a chat
  call, an MCP tool invocation) but many are **not bound to any request**
  (workflow build/start, provider participation, hosting startup). So we use a
  **process-global, monotonic** mask (option S1), which is the only scope that can
  represent the non-request features. Our mask therefore intentionally "bleeds"
  (accumulates) for the life of the process — the opposite of botocore's reset —
  and that is the intended semantic, not the bug botocore guards against.
- **The mechanism is private; the wire format is the contract.** botocore marks
  its whole user-agent module private and "subject to abrupt breaking changes."
  Same for us: the Python/.NET helpers are internal, and only the emitted token +
  the per-language registry tables are the stable, decodable contract.
- **First-party-only emission** is stricter than any of the above; the closest in
  spirit is Stainless headers, which only reach the owning API. We make the
  client/pipeline allowlist explicit (initially Foundry/Azure OpenAI) rather than
  attempting to infer safety from arbitrary request URLs. Other Azure clients
  join only after telemetry access is confirmed.
- **Opt-out naming.** `AZURE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` is the family precedent for our
  `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_*_DISABLED` names. Separately, the cross-tool `DO_NOT_TRACK`
  convention (honored by e.g. HuggingFace Hub) is worth considering — see Open
  Questions.

## Registry versioning and migration (v1 → v2)

The token carries a **per-language** version (`feat=v1.<hex>`); a version bump is
independent for Python and .NET.

- **Additive growth stays on v1 — no bump.** Allocating a new feature to a
  reserved/unused bit is backward-compatible: an older decoder simply sees an
  unknown bit and ignores it. Normal package growth never needs a new
  version.
- **A bump (v2) is required only for breaking changes:** renumbering or
  re-partitioning existing bits, changing the *meaning* of an already-assigned
  index, or widening beyond 128-bit. Within a version an index is **never** reused or
  reassigned — that invariant is what lets old decoders stay correct.
- **The draft 64→128 change is still v1.** No v1 token or enum has shipped, so
  this pre-implementation repartition establishes the initial contract rather
  than migrating an existing one.
- **Mixed-version coexistence is the norm.** A fleet runs many SDK releases at
  once, so `v1` and `v2` tokens appear simultaneously for a long time (old SDKs
  keep emitting `v1`). The decoder keeps **every** published `(language,
  version)` table and selects by the token's version; the `v1` table is retained
  indefinitely for historical decode.
- **Unknown version → do not guess.** A decoder without the `vN` table must
  record "unknown registry version" rather than decode against an older table —
  bit meanings may differ across versions, so mis-attribution is worse than
  no data.
- **Producing v2:** publish the v2 table alongside v1, update the affected
  package-local `FeatureIndex` declarations and SDK version constant, and emit
  `v2` from the release that ships them. Prefer staying on v1 (additive) and
  reserving a clean v2 for an eventual deliberate re-partition.

## Limitations

| Limitation | Caused by (choice) | Why we accepted it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No signal for self-hosted or third-party-only traffic.** If a process never calls Azure/Foundry, we see nothing. | First-party-only emission (A) | We can't read third-party logs anyway, and must not leak a fingerprint into them. Reach traded for privacy. |
| **Not every first-party client is stampable.** Caller-supplied `AIProjectClient` / OpenAI clients and toolkit-owned clients may not expose a supported per-request policy hook. | Supported-hook-only emission (A) | V1 does not mutate caller-owned clients or private SDK pipelines. Those features may still appear on another eligible request from the same process-global mask. |
| **Custom origins intentionally receive no feature token.** A customer gateway may use Azure credentials or Azure-named settings but route to a non-approved origin. | Two-factor destination classification (A) | Credentials and configuration names are not proof of telemetry ownership. Unknown/custom origins and cross-origin redirects are denied by default. |
| **No OTel / per-call signal in v1.** | OTel deferred (C) — primarily on **privacy** and availability grounds | A broadly-emitted span attribute would push the fingerprint into the user's general telemetry / third-party APM vendors, undoing the first-party-only scoping. It also requires customer/user OTel setup, and even Foundry users may not export data where we can query it. Left open only if there is a compelling reason to add. |
| **Mask reflects "usage so far," not the whole session.** Early requests carry fewer bits than later ones. | Process-global accumulator + request-time stamping | Honest and still useful as a Boolean process-lifetime observation. Repeated request rows must not be summed as additional uses. Reading the mask at request time makes it *grow* rather than freeze. |
| **No per-agent / per-call attribution.** The mask is one process-wide value — "this process used X", not "this agent/call used X". | Process-global monotonic scope (S1) | A deliberate choice, not a transport limit: botocore *does* per-call attribution in the UA via a per-request `contextvars` set, but many AF activations (workflow build/start, provider participation, hosting startup) occur outside the service request that later emits the token. Per-call detail remains deferred to OTel. |
| **Shared processes intentionally carry usage across agents and tenants.** A request can include bits first set by another workload in the same worker. | Process-global monotonic scope (S1) | The token must be interpreted only as process-level "used so far," never as request/user/tenant attribution. Privacy review must explicitly accept this. |
| **Bits are binary, sticky observations — not countable events.** Once set, a bit appears on every later eligible request from that process, so raw request counts repeat the same observation and long-lived/high-traffic processes dominate. | Monotonic mask stamped at request time | The signal supports coarse observed-feature and co-occurrence questions only. It cannot provide first-use counts, unique-process counts, request attribution, or feature invocation frequency. |
| **Granularity may be too coarse or too detailed.** The chosen level may miss useful distinctions or create more specificity than needed. | v1 granularity choice (F0-F4) | This is the main remaining decision. Adding bits later is easier than removing/redefining them, so v1 should lean toward fewer bits that answer known questions. |
| **.NET snapshots span two atomic lanes.** A bit can be marked between the low/high reads, so one request may omit that just-added bit. | 128-bit width without a global lock | The mask is monotonic: the snapshot cannot invent or clear a bit, and the next request includes the addition. This matches the existing "usage so far" timing semantics. |
| **Fingerprinting risk is reduced, not eliminated.** A feature-combination mask is still a deployment signature, and it transits intermediaries (proxies/CDNs) even when first-party-scoped. | Emitting any feature-combination value | Scope + opt-out + coarse granularity mitigate it; v1 should avoid unnecessary detailed bits. |

## Open Questions (for decider discussion)

These are unresolved and should be decided before implementation:

1. **Which v1 granularity level (F0-F4)?** This is the primary remaining choice.
   Adding bits later is easier than removing or redefining bits, so v1 should
   choose the least detailed level that answers known questions and avoids a quick
   v2.
2. **Privacy approval for the v1 User-Agent signal.** Before implementation,
   confirm that a transparent, opt-out, first-party-only feature-combination
   fingerprint is acceptable, including the exact client allowlist, retention,
   access, and permitted product queries. This is a rollout precondition.
3. **When (if ever) to add the OTel path?** Held back mainly for **privacy** and
   data availability: a span attribute broadcasts the fingerprint into the user's
   general telemetry and onward to third-party APM vendors, contradicting the
   first-party-only stance, and it requires user-side OTel setup that may not make
   the data available to us even for Foundry users. It also carries a
   metric-cardinality hazard. Revisit only if the User-Agent path cannot answer a
   concrete question.
4. **Honor the cross-tool `DO_NOT_TRACK` convention?** Several ecosystems treat
   `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` as a universal telemetry opt-out (HuggingFace Hub honors it;
   see [Prior art](#prior-art)). Should our mask opt-out also respect
   `DO_NOT_TRACK` (in addition to `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_FEATURE_MASK_DISABLED` and
   Python's pre-existing whole-UA flag)? Cheap to add and
   community-friendly, but it widens the opt-out surface and needs a clear
   precedence rule. Recommend yes; confirm with the deciders.

### Decided

- **Dedicated opt-out flag — included.** In addition to the existing
  Python `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_USER_AGENT_DISABLED` (drops the whole UA), v1 ships
  `AGENT_FRAMEWORK_FEATURE_MASK_DISABLED`, which drops **only** the feature mask
  while keeping the base SDK identity/version User-Agent. This lets a
  privacy-conscious user withhold the usage signal without losing the
  support/compat value of the SDK-version header. .NET adopts the dedicated
  mask-only flag; adding a .NET whole-User-Agent switch is outside this decision.
- **Caller-owned clients are not modified.** V1 stamps only framework-created
  clients or clients with a supported public policy/hook registration point. It
  does not patch private pipelines; injected clients are an explicit coverage
  limitation.
- **Destination approval is explicit and redirect-aware.** An eligible pipeline
  still emits only to a reviewed HTTPS origin. Custom origins are default-deny,
  and the token is removed on an unapproved redirect hop.
- **Telemetry does not replace transport defaults.** Framework-created OpenAI
  clients use the SDK's default async HTTP client with the request hook added,
  preserving redirect, timeout, connection-limit, and pooling behavior.
- **Marking uses activation, not DI construction.** Operational surfaces mark on
  first real use; a constructor marks only when construction itself exercises or
  registers the capability.
