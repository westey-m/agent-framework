"""Foundry Hosted Agent host for the production-ready claw.

Observability requires no exporter setup here. Agent Framework is natively instrumented (on by
default), and the Foundry hosting runtime collects and exports the traces, metrics, and logs — so
there is no ``configure_otel_providers()`` call. When deployed, Foundry injects
``APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`` automatically. To capture prompt/response content, set
``ENABLE_SENSITIVE_DATA=true`` (see ``agent.yaml``). Because the exporters are Foundry-managed, run
this host with ``azd ai agent run`` to see telemetry; running it directly won't export anything.

File access and shell are disabled on the hosted container (see ``enable_file_access`` /
``enable_shell`` below). File memory stays enabled, but its store is pointed at a writable directory
under the home directory.

Environment variables:
    FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT       — Microsoft Foundry project endpoint URL
    AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME — Model deployment name for the hosted agent
    TOOLBOX_MCP_SERVER_URL         — Optional Foundry Toolbox MCP endpoint URL
    PURVIEW_CLIENT_APP_ID          — Optional app/client ID; enables Purview
    ENABLE_SENSITIVE_DATA          — Enables sensitive telemetry capture (prompts/responses) when true

Run locally:
    uv run python/samples/02-agents/harness/build_your_own_claw/claw_step04_production_ready/hosted.py

    Two constraints make this necessary:

    * Foundry surfaces the container's **stderr** stream, so ``print`` (stdout) output never
      appears in the hosted logs.
    * The agentserver SDK attaches its own stderr handler to the root logger, but only once the
      host starts — which is *after* the agent is built below. Without this call, the diagnostics
      emitted while building the agent would reach a handler-less root logger and be dropped by
      ``logging.lastResort`` (level ``WARNING``).

    The SDK skips adding its handler when one is already present, so this does not double-log.
