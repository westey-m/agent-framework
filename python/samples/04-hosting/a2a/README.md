# A2A Agent Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating how to create and use agents with the A2A (Agent2Agent) protocol from the `agent_framework` package to communicate with remote A2A agents.

By default the A2AAgent waits for the remote agent to finish before returning (`background=False`), so long-running A2A tasks are handled transparently. For advanced scenarios where you need to poll or resubscribe to in-progress tasks using continuation tokens, see the [background responses sample](../../02-agents/background_responses.py).

## Examples

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`agent_with_a2a.py`](agent_with_a2a.py) | Demonstrates agent discovery, non-streaming and streaming responses using the A2A protocol. |

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables before running the example:

### Required
- `A2A_AGENT_HOST`: URL of a single A2A agent (for simple sample, e.g., `http://localhost:5001/`)


## Quick Testing with .NET A2A Servers

For quick testing and demonstration, you can use the pre-built .NET A2A servers from this repository:

**Quick Testing Reference**: Use the .NET A2A Client Server sample at:
`..\agent-framework\dotnet\samples\A2AClientServer`

### Run Python A2A Sample
```powershell
# Simple A2A sample (single agent)
uv run python agent_with_a2a.py
```
