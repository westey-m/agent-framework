# Shared State Workflow Sample

This sample demonstrates how executors in a durable workflow can share state via `IWorkflowContext`. State written by one executor is accessible to all downstream executors, persisted across supersteps, and survives process restarts.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Writing state with `QueueStateUpdateAsync` — executors store data for downstream executors
- Reading state with `ReadStateAsync` — executors access data written by earlier executors
- Lazy initialization with `ReadOrInitStateAsync` — initialize state only if not already present
- Custom scopes with `scopeName` — partition state into isolated namespaces (e.g., `"shipping"`)
- Clearing scopes with `QueueClearScopeAsync` — remove all entries under a scope when no longer needed
- Early termination with `RequestHaltAsync` — halt the workflow when validation fails
- State persistence across supersteps — the orchestration passes shared state to each executor
- Event streaming with `IStreamingWorkflowRun` — observe executor progress in real time

## Workflow

**OrderPipeline**: `ValidateOrder` → `EnrichOrder` → `ProcessPayment` → `GenerateInvoice`

Return values carry primary business data through the pipeline (`OrderDetails` → `OrderDetails` → payment ref → invoice string). Shared state carries side-channel data that doesn't belong in the message chain:

| Executor | Returns (message flow) | Reads from State | Writes to State |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **ValidateOrder** | `OrderDetails` | — | `taxRate`, `auditValidate` |
| **EnrichOrder** | `OrderDetails` (pass-through) | `auditValidate` | `shippingTier`, `auditEnrich`, `carrier` (scope: shipping) |
| **ProcessPayment** | payment ref string | `taxRate` | `auditPayment` |
| **GenerateInvoice** | invoice string | `auditValidate`, `auditEnrich`, `auditPayment`, `carrier` (scope: shipping) | clears `shipping` scope |

> [!NOTE]
> `EnrichOrder` writes `carrier` under the `"shipping"` scope using `scopeName: "shipping"`. This keeps the key separate from keys written without a scope, so `"carrier"` in the `"shipping"` scope won't collide with a `"carrier"` key written elsewhere.

## Environment Setup

See the [README.md](../../README.md) file in the parent directory for more information on how to configure the environment, including how to install and run common sample dependencies.

## Running the Sample

```bash
dotnet run
```

Enter an order ID when prompted. The workflow will process the order through all four executors, streaming events as they occur:

```text
> ORD-001
Started run: abc123
    Wrote to shared state: taxRate = 8.5%
    Wrote to shared state: auditValidate
  [Output] ValidateOrder: Order 'ORD-001' validated. Customer: Jerry, Amount: $249.99
    Read from shared state: shippingTier = Express
    Wrote to shared state: carrier = Contoso Express (scope: shipping)
    Read from shared state: auditValidate (previous step: ValidateOrder)
    Wrote to shared state: auditEnrich
  [Output] EnrichOrder: Order enriched. Shipping: Express (previous step: ValidateOrder)
    Read from shared state: taxRate = 8.5%
    Wrote to shared state: auditPayment
  [Output] ProcessPayment: Payment processed. Total: $271.24 (tax: $21.25). Ref: PAY-abc123def456
    Read from shared state: 3 audit entries
    Read from shared state: carrier = Contoso Express (scope: shipping)
    Cleared shared state scope: shipping
  [Output] GenerateInvoice: Invoice complete. Payment: "PAY-abc123def456". Audit trail: [ValidateOrder → EnrichOrder → ProcessPayment]
  Completed: Invoice complete. Payment: "PAY-abc123def456". Audit trail: [ValidateOrder → EnrichOrder → ProcessPayment]
```

### Viewing Workflows in the DTS Dashboard

After running a workflow, you can navigate to the Durable Task Scheduler (DTS) dashboard to inspect the orchestration status, executor inputs/outputs, and events.

If you are using the DTS emulator, the dashboard is available at `http://localhost:8082`.

To inspect shared state in the dashboard, click on an executor to view its input and output. The input contains a snapshot of the shared state the executor ran with, and the output includes any state updates it made (as `stateUpdates` with scoped keys).
