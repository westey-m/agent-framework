# Vector stores

Vector stores accept multiple model styles so applications can keep the data
representation that already fits their validation, memory, and interoperability
needs. When you own a model, annotate a dataclass, Pydantic model, msgspec
struct, or plain class. When another team or package owns it, register an
explicit definition and codecs. Dictionaries use a collection-specific
definition; DataFrames and other containers can convert to row dictionaries
before calling the batch API.

No database is needed for the in-memory examples. The model, format, and direct
in-memory filter samples need no credentials. The search-tool sample loads the
existing Azure AI Search hotel dataset and uses OpenAI for embeddings and the
agent; set `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running it.

| File | Demonstrates |
|------|--------------|
| [`vector_store_models.py`](vector_store_models.py) | Choosing among owned models, third-party model registration, and loose dictionary definitions. |
| [`optimized_data_formats.py`](optimized_data_formats.py) | Keeping NumPy vector fields and adapting pandas DataFrames to the batch record API. |
| [`in_memory_filters.py`](in_memory_filters.py) | Direct vector search with `Filter` and `FilterGroup`. |
| [`in_memory_search_tool.py`](in_memory_search_tool.py) | Model-set filter values with native typed `Param` declarations. |
| [`redis_store.py`](redis_store.py) | Native HASH and JSON storage, vector search, filtering, and lifecycle with a disposable Redis server. |

The Redis example requires Redis 8.0.3+ with Search and RedisJSON, but no
embedding API. See the [Redis package documentation](../../../packages/redis/README.md)
for setup and supported filter/score semantics.

The first section shows the two equivalent custom-codec registration forms.
`@vectorstoremodel` derives the definition from annotations and registers it;
`register_vectorstoremodel` accepts an externally constructed definition.
Both produce the same internal model registration.

The sample order is informed by a small benchmark on Apple Silicon with
CPython 3.13. Each benchmark model had the same `id`, `text`, and `vector`
fields. Results are medians of seven warmed runs:

| Model style | 3-element vector | 1,566-element vector |
|-------------|-----------------:|---------------------:|
| Custom codecs | 2.60 μs | 7.01 μs |
| Dictionary | 2.39 μs | 6.60 μs |
| Plain class | 3.46 μs | 12.26 μs |
| msgspec `Struct` | 3.03 μs | 16.61 μs |
| Dataclass | 3.17 μs | 16.81 μs |
| Pydantic | 5.52 μs | 37.32 μs |

These results measure only the framework's internal record conversion path.
They do not include database SDK conversion, network I/O,
embedding generation, validation complexity, nested fields, alternate vector
representations, or memory allocation. Custom codecs are especially favorable
here because the benchmark codec returns the existing vector reference rather
than copying it. The middle ordering also changes with vector size, so treat
these timings as illustrative data, not a recommendation or performance
guarantee.

Array-like vector values, including NumPy arrays, are serialized through their
`tolist()` method without making NumPy a core dependency. If a model must
restore a NumPy array instead of a Python list, pass a custom `decoder` to
`@vectorstoremodel` or `register_vectorstoremodel` and call `numpy.array` or
`numpy.asarray` there.

Run the sample from the `python` directory:

```bash
uv run samples/02-agents/vector_stores/vector_store_models.py
uv run samples/02-agents/vector_stores/optimized_data_formats.py
uv run samples/02-agents/vector_stores/in_memory_filters.py
uv run samples/02-agents/vector_stores/in_memory_search_tool.py
```
