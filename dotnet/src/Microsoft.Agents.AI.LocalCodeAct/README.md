# Microsoft.Agents.AI.LocalCodeAct

Local CodeAct integration for Microsoft Agent Framework.

`Microsoft.Agents.AI.LocalCodeAct` is intended for environments that already
provide process, filesystem, network, and credential isolation (e.g., Azure
container instances, VMs, or Foundry hosted agents). It provides the familiar
CodeAct provider pattern used by the Hyperlight package while executing Python
locally in the agent environment.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.LocalCodeAct --prerelease
```

This is a preview package.

## Basic Usage

```csharp
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI.LocalCodeAct;

var options = new LocalCodeActProviderOptions()
{
    ExecutionLimits = new ProcessExecutionLimits { TimeoutSeconds = 5 },
};

using var provider = new LocalCodeActProvider("/usr/bin/python3", options);

// Register provider with your AIAgent's context providers.
```

## What the Package Controls

- **AST validation** (default on): Validates generated code against allow-lists
  before execution.
- **Subprocess execution**: Runs generated code in a child Python process.
- **Explicit Python path**: the provider and standalone function constructors require a Python executable path (no default).
- **Isolated environment**: Does not inherit host environment variables unless
  explicitly provided.
- **No shell invocation**: Launches Python directly without a shell.
- **Resource limits**: Applies timeout, stdout, stderr, and result-size limits.
- **Tool gating**: Only provider-owned host tools can be invoked from generated
  code via `await call_tool("<name>", ...)`.
- **File capture**: Captures new files under configured **read-write** mounts
  while skipping symlinks. Modifications to pre-existing files are not captured.

These are defense-in-depth controls, not a containment boundary. The AST
validator blocks common dangerous operations (`eval`, `exec`,
`import subprocess`, attribute access for `os.system`, `__class__`, etc.) but
does not make Python execution safe on an unsandboxed host.

## What the Package Does NOT Protect

- Malicious Python code working within allowed imports and operations.
- Network access unless the surrounding environment blocks it.
- Prompt-injected exfiltration through allowed host tools.
- Resource exhaustion outside the configured limits.
- Log, stdout, stderr, or result poisoning.

**Use Azure container instances, VMs, Foundry hosted agents, or equivalent
infrastructure as the actual security boundary.**

## Host Tools

Register host tools via the options or on the provider directly:

```csharp
var addFunction = AIFunctionFactory.Create(
    (int a, int b) => a + b,
    name: "add",
    description: "Adds two integers.");

using var provider = new LocalCodeActProvider("/usr/bin/python3", new LocalCodeActProviderOptions
{
    Tools = new[] { addFunction },
});

// Or mutate after construction:
provider.AddTools(addFunction);
```

Inside `execute_code`:

```python
total = await call_tool("add", a=2, b=3)
print(total)
```

## Tool Approval

Generated code reaches registered tools through `call_tool(...)`, which invokes
them directly. A per-tool approval interaction cannot be surfaced at that point,
so approval is **bundled** onto `execute_code` instead:

* If any registered tool is an `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`, `execute_code`
  itself requires approval before the code runs.
* `LocalCodeActApprovalMode.AlwaysRequire` makes `execute_code` require approval
  regardless of the registered tools.

```csharp
var deploy = new ApprovalRequiredAIFunction(
    AIFunctionFactory.Create(RunDeployment, name: "deploy"));

using var provider = new LocalCodeActProvider("/usr/bin/python3", new LocalCodeActProviderOptions
{
    Tools = new[] { deploy },
    // ApprovalMode = LocalCodeActApprovalMode.AlwaysRequire, // optional, opt-in
});
```

For `LocalCodeActProvider`, approval is recomputed on every run, so tools added
via `AddTools` after construction are taken into account. `LocalExecuteCodeFunction`
captures its tools at construction time and exposes the approval requirement
through `GetService<ApprovalRequiredAIFunction>()`.

## Code Validation

By default, the package validates Python code against allow-lists before
execution. The validator runs in its own short-lived Python subprocess with a
dedicated timeout (`ProcessExecutionLimits.ValidationTimeoutSeconds`).

- **Allowed imports**: `math`, `random`, `json`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `os`,
  etc. OS access is limited to lexical `os.path` transformations and read-only
  access to the scrubbed `os.environ` mapping.
- **Blocked imports**: `subprocess`, `sys`, `socket`, `importlib`, network and
  threading modules, etc.
- **Allowed builtins**: `print`, `len`, `str`, type constructors, etc.
- **Blocked builtins**: `__builtins__`, `__loader__`, `__spec__`, `eval`, `exec`,
  `compile`, `__import__`, `open`, `getattr`, `setattr`, etc.

`str.format` and `str.format_map` method access is blocked because replacement
fields perform runtime attribute and item traversal that is invisible to AST
validation. Use f-strings or the `format()` builtin instead; f-string
expressions are validated as regular AST nodes.

Runtime annotation evaluation is restricted as well. Access to ForwardRef
evaluation methods (`_evaluate`, `evaluate`), annotation helpers (`_eval_type`,
`evaluate_forward_ref`, `get_type_hints`, `get_annotations`), and the
`functools.singledispatch`/`singledispatchmethod` factories is blocked.
These helpers can evaluate annotation strings outside the inspected AST,
including during annotation-inferred dispatch registration.

Ordinary typing constructs, ForwardRef construction, unevaluated annotation
declarations, and other functools utilities remain available. Generator
expressions, async-generator expressions, and async functions are also allowed,
but access to their `gi_frame`, `ag_frame`, and `cr_frame` attributes is
blocked.

Frame payload attributes (`f_builtins`, `f_globals`, and `f_locals`) are also
blocked regardless of how a frame is obtained. Generated code may inspect
non-payload task stack information, but it cannot recover the runner's builtin,
global, or local namespaces from those frames.

Capability restrictions apply at attribute access and from-import acquisition,
before references can be aliased. Receiver types are not statically knowable,
so unrelated attributes with the same names are also rejected. This includes
harmless annotation resolution, non-evaluating modes of the blocked helpers,
and otherwise-safe explicit-type singledispatch registration.

OS-derived aliases retain the same restrictions. Filesystem-querying path
helpers, environment mutation, unknown descendants, and reflective access are
rejected by default.

See [`Resources/validator.py`](Resources/validator.py) for the full default
allow-lists.

### Customizing Validation

Override the default lists:

```csharp
using var provider = new LocalCodeActProvider("/usr/bin/python3", new LocalCodeActProviderOptions
{
    AllowedImports = new[] { "math", "datetime", "mymodule" },
    BlockedImports = new[] { "subprocess", "sys" },
    AllowedBuiltins = new[] { "print", "len", "str", "int" },
    BlockedBuiltins = new[] { "eval", "exec", "compile" },
});
```

Custom lists **replace** the defaults (not augment).

Fixed attribute and AST-node restrictions remain in effect independently of
these lists. Allowing a module does not enable its blocked capability or
runtime-traversal attributes.

### Disabling Validation

Set `ValidationDisabled = true` to skip the AST validator entirely. Doing so
removes a critical defense-in-depth control. Only disable when the generated
code is trusted or when running inside a strong external sandbox.

## File Mounts

Mount host directories to expose them to generated code:

```csharp
using var provider = new LocalCodeActProvider("/usr/bin/python3", new LocalCodeActProviderOptions
{
    FileMounts = new[]
    {
        new FileMount("/tmp/data", "/input", FileMountMode.ReadOnly),
        new FileMount("/tmp/output", "/output", FileMountMode.ReadWrite),
    },
});
```

Generated code accesses mounts via `HostPath`. `MountPath` is descriptive
metadata only — the subprocess sees the real host path. Read-write mounts are
scanned for **new** files after execution, and those files are returned as
`DataContent`. Symlinks are skipped.

## Environment Variables

Pass environment variables explicitly. The subprocess does NOT inherit the host
environment by default. On Windows, the system variables required for Python to
load its standard library are retained:

```csharp
using var provider = new LocalCodeActProvider("/usr/bin/python3", new LocalCodeActProviderOptions
{
    Environment = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        ["API_KEY"] = "...",
        ["LOG_LEVEL"] = "INFO",
    },
});
```

## Standalone Function

If you do not want the provider machinery you can expose `execute_code` directly:

```csharp
var function = new LocalExecuteCodeFunction("/usr/bin/python3");
```

`LocalExecuteCodeFunction` snapshots tools and mounts at construction time and
is safe to reuse across invocations.

## Execution Modes

The .NET implementation only supports subprocess execution. There is no
"unsafe in-process" mode in .NET.
