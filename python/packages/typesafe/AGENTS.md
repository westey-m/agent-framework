# TypeSafe AI Package (`agent-framework-typesafe`)

Integration with TypeSafe AI System One models, including Jev.

## Public API

- **`TypeSafeChatClient`** - Adds function invocation, middleware, and telemetry to the TypeSafe transport.
- **`RawTypeSafeChatClient`** - Provider transport that can emit constrained function calls but does not execute
  them; it has no function-invocation, middleware, or telemetry layers.
- **`TypeSafeChatOptions`** - Uses `response_format` for the required TypeSafe `Questions` mapping.

## Behavioral Contract

- Calls always return structured `SystemOneResponse` data. This provider does not generate free-form chat text.
- Every call requires `response_format` to contain at least one TypeSafe `Noul`, `Choice`, or `Score` question.
- Streaming and non-text message content are not supported.
- Tool calling defaults to one call per run; callers can opt into sequential round trips with
  `FunctionInvocationConfiguration.max_function_calls`. Closed-set schemas support constants, enums/Literals,
  booleans, and arrays of enums/Literals. Optional supported arguments use a presence question so omitted values
  preserve tool defaults.
- Agent-provided MCP tools work when their discovered function schemas fit the supported subset. Direct raw/client
  calls must receive expanded `FunctionTool` instances.
- A tool is excluded if any declared argument or object/argument/array-item schema constraint is unsupported. Tool,
  property, enum, and cumulative question counts are bounded before question materialization, and constrained arrays
  or array enum members that do not match the declared item type are rejected.
- Assertion siblings beside `$ref` or nullable `anyOf` are rejected, and routing criteria always include the exact
  function name plus its optional description.
- The connector forwards `response_format` as the TypeSafe SDK `questions` argument and internally uses
  `SystemOneResponse` as the response model.
- An injected `AsyncTypeSafeClient` is caller-owned. A client created by `TypeSafeChatClient` is closed by
  `close()` or the async context manager.
- Connector-owned clients restore the configured `Bearer` API-key header at the HTTP transport boundary because
  TypeSafe SDK 0.7.1 keeps the prepared authorization header redacted; transport-level tests must verify the outgoing
  header.
- Settings use `load_settings`; the API key is required only when the connector creates the SDK client.
- Injected SDK clients remain authoritative: ambient model and endpoint settings are not applied to them.

## Import Path

This package is alpha and is not included in `agent-framework-core[all]`.
