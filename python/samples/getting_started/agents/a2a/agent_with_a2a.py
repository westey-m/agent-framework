Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration Sample

This sample demonstrates how to connect to and communicate with external agents using
the A2A protocol. A2A is a standardized communication protocol that enables interoperability
between different agent systems, allowing agents built with different frameworks and
technologies to communicate seamlessly.

By default the A2AAgent waits for the remote agent to finish before returning (background=False).
This means long-running A2A tasks are handled transparently — the caller simply awaits the result.
For advanced scenarios where you need to poll or resubscribe to in-progress tasks, see the
background_responses sample: samples/concepts/background_responses.py

For more information about the A2A protocol specification, visit: https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Discovering A2A-compliant agents using AgentCard resolution
- Creating A2AAgent instances to wrap external A2A endpoints
- Non-streaming request/response
- Streaming responses to receive incremental updates via SSE

To run this sample:
1. Set the A2A_AGENT_HOST environment variable to point to an A2A-compliant agent endpoint
   Example: export A2A_AGENT_HOST="https://your-a2a-agent.example.com"
2. Ensure the target agent exposes its AgentCard at /.well-known/agent.json
3. Run: uv run python agent_with_a2a.py

Visit the README.md for more details on setting up and running A2A agents.
