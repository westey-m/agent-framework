class WorkflowCheckpoint:
    """Represents a complete checkpoint of workflow state.

    Checkpoints capture the full execution state of a workflow at a specific point,
    enabling workflows to be paused and resumed.

    Note that a checkpoint is not tied to a specific workflow instance, but rather to
    a workflow definition (identified by workflow_name and graph_signature_hash). Thus,
    the ID of the workflow instance that created the checkpoint is not included in the
    checkpoint data. This allows checkpoints to be shared and restored across different
    workflow instances of the same workflow definition.

    Attributes:
        workflow_name: Name of the workflow this checkpoint belongs to. This acts as a
            logical grouping for checkpoints and can be used to filter checkpoints by
            workflow. Workflows with the same name are expected to have compatible graph
            structures for checkpointing.
        graph_signature_hash: Hash of the workflow graph topology to validate checkpoint
            compatibility during restore
        checkpoint_id: Unique identifier for this checkpoint
        previous_checkpoint_id: ID of the previous checkpoint in the chain, if any. This
            allows chaining checkpoints together to form a history of workflow states.
        timestamp: ISO 8601 timestamp when checkpoint was created
        messages: Messages exchanged between executors
        state: Committed workflow state including user data, executor states, and
            edge runner delivery state. This contains only committed state; pending
            state changes are not included in checkpoints. Executor states are stored
            under the reserved key '_executor_state', and edge runner state, such as
            partially filled fan-in buffers, under '_edge_state'.
        pending_request_info_events: Any pending request info events that have not
            yet been processed at the time of checkpointing. This allows the workflow
            to resume with the correct pending events after a restore.
        iteration_count: Current iteration number when checkpoint was created.
            Note: iteration_count is not guaranteed to be unique across a workflow's
            lifecycle. It marks the superstep boundary the checkpoint sits on, and the
            same boundary can carry more than one checkpoint. For example, a run that
            pauses at ``IDLE_WITH_PENDING_REQUESTS`` records a checkpoint after superstep
            K; when responses are later delivered, a response-entry checkpoint is recorded
            at the same iteration K (responses in-flight, before superstep K+1 runs).
            Both share iteration K but are distinct checkpoints. Checkpoint ordering is
            defined by the ``previous_checkpoint_id`` lineage chain (and ``timestamp``),
            not by ``iteration_count``; do not use ``iteration_count`` to identify the
            latest checkpoint in human-in-the-loop flows.
        metadata: Additional metadata (e.g., superstep info, graph signature)
        version: Checkpoint format version

    Note:
        The state dict may contain reserved keys managed by the framework.
        See State class documentation for details on reserved keys.

# Process-wide serialization of writes per destination file.
#
# asyncio.Lock is loop-bound, so a per-(loop, checkpoint-id) registry cannot
# serialize two FileCheckpointStorage instances pointed at the same directory, nor one
# instance driven from two event loops. Ownership is therefore handed out by a
# process-wide queue keyed by the canonical destination path, and taken *before* the
# write is submitted to a worker thread rather than inside it.
#
# Hand-off runs over ``concurrent.futures.Future`` signals, which are not bound to a
# loop, so a single chain orders writers regardless of which loop enqueued them, and
# waiters suspend on the event loop instead of occupying an ``asyncio.to_thread``
# worker. Blocking on a ``threading.Lock`` inside the worker instead -- the original
# design -- let a burst of same-path saves fill the default executor and stall unrelated
# ``to_thread`` work, including checkpoint loads, and could deadlock once the write that
# had to finish first was queued behind those waiters.
#
# Those signals are awaited through ``_wait_for_signal``, never ``asyncio.wrap_future``.
# Cancellation is the reason: ``wrap_future`` chains it into the future it wraps, so one
# cancelled waiter would cancel the signal an earlier writer still has to resolve, and
# the ``asyncio`` task wrapping a submitted write reports ``done()`` while its function
# is still running on the executor thread. Both let a later save start its ``os.replace``
# beside an earlier one, after which the earlier write can land last and overwrite the
# newer checkpoint.
#
# Entries are reference-counted by queued-or-running operations and dropped when the
# last one releases, so a process that saves many distinct checkpoint IDs -- the
# default, since ``WorkflowCheckpoint`` generates a fresh UUID -- does not retain an
# entry per ID for its lifetime.
#
# The scope really is one process. Several replicas sharing a checkpoint directory -- a
# mounted volume, a network share -- get no serialization from this, because there is no
# shared state between them to coordinate through. Concurrent saves of the same
# checkpoint ID from different processes still rely on ``os.replace`` being atomic on
# the underlying filesystem for the file not to be seen half-written; which write
# survives is undefined.
