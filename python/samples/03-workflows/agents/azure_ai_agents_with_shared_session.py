Sample: Agents with a shared thread in a workflow

A Writer agent generates content, then a Reviewer agent critiques it, sharing a common message thread.

Purpose:
Show how to use a shared thread between multiple agents in a workflow.
By default, agents have individual threads, but sharing a thread allows them to share all messages.

Notes:
- Not all agents can share threads; usually only the same type of agents can share threads.

Demonstrate:
- Creating multiple agents with AzureOpenAIResponsesClient.
- Setting up a shared thread between agents.

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME must be set to your Azure OpenAI model deployment name.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with agents, workflows, and executors in the agent framework.
