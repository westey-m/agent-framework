# Orchestration Getting Started Samples

## Installation

The orchestrations package is included when you install `agent-framework` (which pulls in all optional packages):

```bash
pip install agent-framework
```

Or install the orchestrations package directly:

```bash
pip install agent-framework-orchestrations
```

Orchestration builders are available via the `agent_framework.orchestrations` submodule:

```python
from agent_framework.orchestrations import (
    SequentialBuilder,
    ConcurrentBuilder,
    HandoffBuilder,
    GroupChatBuilder,
    MagenticBuilder,
)
```

## Tips

**Magentic checkpointing tip**: Treat `MagenticBuilder.participants` keys as stable identifiers. When resuming from a checkpoint, the rebuilt workflow must reuse the same participant names; otherwise the checkpoint cannot be applied and the run will fail fast.

**Handoff workflow tip**: Handoff workflows maintain the full conversation history including any `Message.additional_properties` emitted by your agents. This ensures routing metadata remains intact across all agent transitions. For specialist-to-specialist handoffs, use `.add_handoff(source, targets)` to configure which agents can route to which others with a fluent, type-safe API.

**Sequential orchestration note**: Sequential orchestration uses a few small adapter nodes for plumbing:
- `input-conversation` normalizes input to `list[Message]`
- `to-conversation:<participant>` converts agent responses into the shared conversation
- `complete` publishes the final output event (type='output')

These may appear in event streams (executor_invoked/executor_completed). They're analogous to concurrent's dispatcher and aggregator and can be ignored if you only care about agent activity.

## Environment Variables

Orchestration samples that use `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient` expect:

- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` (Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint)
- `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` (model deployment name)

These values are passed directly into the client constructor via `os.getenv()` in sample code.
