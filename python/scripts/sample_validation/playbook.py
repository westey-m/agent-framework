"""Cached validation playbooks.

A *playbook* is a small JSON recipe that captures exactly how a sample was
successfully validated so future runs can replay it deterministically without
invoking an LLM agent. The agent produces a playbook the first time it
validates a sample; subsequent runs replay it directly and only fall back to
the agent when the playbook is missing, stale (the sample changed), or the
replay fails.

The playbook payload is an agent-authored **Python validation script**. Replaying
a playbook writes that script to a temporary file and runs it with the active
interpreter, treating a zero exit code as success. A single script can validate
any sample shape: a plain sample that runs to completion, or a long-lived server
sample (e.g. a hosted agent) that must be started in the background, exercised
over HTTP, asserted, and then torn down.
