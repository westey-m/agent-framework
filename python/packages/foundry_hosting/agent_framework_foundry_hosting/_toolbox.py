class FoundryToolbox(MCPStreamableHTTPTool):
    """A Foundry toolbox exposed as an MCP tool, with hosting wired in.

    This is a thin convenience wrapper over :class:`~agent_framework.MCPStreamableHTTPTool`
    that targets a Microsoft Foundry toolbox endpoint. Compared to constructing an
    ``MCPStreamableHTTPTool`` by hand it:

    - resolves the toolbox endpoint and tool name from the environment when not given,
    - authenticates every request with a bearer token from ``credential``, and
    - forwards the platform per-request call-id (``x-agent-foundry-call-id``) so the
      Foundry MCP proxy can resolve the caller context server-side.

    The call-id forwarding is transparent: it is read from the request-scoped context
    the hosting endpoint binds on each request, so no per-request wiring is needed.
    Because the toolbox endpoint is a first-party Foundry service, forwarding the
    opaque caller token to it is safe.

    Like any MCP tool, the connection lifecycle is driven by the agent: the hosting
    server enters the agent, which connects the toolbox on first use and closes it
    (and the HTTP client it owns) at shutdown. Using it as an ``async with`` context
    manager directly is supported but not required.

        session and exposes them through a provider you can pass to an agent via
        ``context_providers=[...]``.

        The toolbox must be **connected** before its skills are discovered (which

        and no tools -- or by entering it as an ``async with`` context manager.

        Keyword Args:
            source_id: Unique identifier for the provider instance.

                authorization, not which skills are listed), so a single shared cache
                is safe.
            cache_refresh_interval: Optional duration after which the cached skill
                discovery is considered stale and re-read from the toolbox on the next
                agent run. Useful when a toolbox's attached skills change over the
                process lifetime. When ``None`` (the default), the cache never expires.
                Ignored when ``disable_caching=True``.
            disable_load_skill_approval: When ``True``, register the provider's
                ``load_skill`` tool with ``approval_mode="never_require"`` so loading
                a skill body needs no host approval. Set this for unattended agents
                (for example, an agent hosted behind :class:`ResponsesHostServer`,
                which runs without an :class:`~agent_framework.AgentSession` and so
                cannot satisfy the default approval flow). Defaults to ``False``.

        Returns:
            A :class:`~agent_framework.SkillsProvider` that advertises and loads the
