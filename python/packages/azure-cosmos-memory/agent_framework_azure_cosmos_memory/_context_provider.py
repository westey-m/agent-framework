        Args:
            source_id: Unique identifier for this provider instance.
            cosmos_endpoint: Cosmos DB account endpoint.
                Can be set via ``COSMOS_ENDPOINT``.
            cosmos_database: Cosmos DB database name.
                Can be set via ``COSMOS_DATABASE``.
            foundry_endpoint: Azure AI Foundry project endpoint for LLM and embeddings.
                Can be set via ``FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT``.
            embedding_model: Embedding model deployment name. Required (no default) when the
                provider builds the client; can be set via ``EMBEDDING_MODEL``. There is no safe
                long-term default, so an unset value raises rather than silently targeting a model
                that may not be deployed.
            chat_model: Chat model deployment name. Required (no default) when the provider builds
                the client; can be set via ``CHAT_MODEL``. There is no safe long-term default, so
                an unset value raises rather than silently targeting a model that may not be
                deployed.
            credential: Azure credential for authentication. When provided it is used for both
                Cosmos DB and AI Foundry; when ``None`` the toolkit builds (and owns) a
                ``DefaultAzureCredential``.
            memory_client: Pre-created AsyncCosmosMemoryClient.
            top_k: Number of memories to retrieve in search.
            min_confidence: Minimum confidence score (0.0-1.0) for retrieved memories.
            memory_types: Types of memories to retrieve. Default: ["fact", "procedural"].
            context_prompt: Prompt to prepend to retrieved memories.
            auto_extract: Enable automatic background memory extraction/summarization after
                turn writes. When ``False`` the cadence thresholds are zeroed so nothing runs
                automatically and callers drive processing via ``memory_client.process_now()``.
                Only applied when the provider builds the client; supplying ``memory_client``
                together with ``auto_extract=False`` raises ``ValueError``.
            processor_config: Optional processor cadence configuration, forwarded to the toolkit
                client via ``cadence_thresholds``. Only applied when the provider builds the
                client; supplying ``memory_client`` together with ``processor_config`` raises
                ``ValueError`` (configure cadence on your own client instead).
            prompts_dir: Optional directory of Prompty templates for the memory pipeline. When
                set, the extraction and summarization steps read their templates (including
                ``extract_memories.prompty``) from this directory instead of the toolkit's
                bundled defaults, letting you customize what the extraction LLM produces. The
                directory must contain the full template set. Applies whether the client is built
                by the provider or supplied via ``memory_client``.
