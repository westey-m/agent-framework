// This sample demonstrates how to use GroupChatBuilder with tools that require human
// approval before execution. A group of specialized agents collaborate on a task, and
// sensitive tool calls trigger human-in-the-loop approval.
//
// This sample works as follows:
// 1. A GroupChatBuilder workflow is created with multiple specialized agents.
// 2. A custom manager determines which agent speaks next based on conversation state.
// 3. Agents collaborate on a software deployment task.
// 4. When the deployment agent tries to deploy to production, it triggers an approval request.
// 5. The sample simulates human approval and the workflow completes.
//
// Purpose:
// Show how tool call approvals integrate with multi-agent group chat workflows where
// different agents have different levels of tool access.
//
// Demonstrate:
// - Using custom GroupChatManager with agents that have approval-required tools.
// - Handling FunctionApprovalRequestContent in group chat scenarios.
// - Multi-round group chat with tool approval interruption and resumption.
