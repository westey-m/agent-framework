"""
Sample: Workflow as Agent with Checkpointing

Purpose:
This sample demonstrates how to use checkpointing with a workflow wrapped as an agent.
It shows how to enable checkpoint storage when calling agent.run(),
allowing workflow execution state to be persisted and potentially resumed.

What you learn:
- How to pass checkpoint_storage to WorkflowAgent.run()
- How checkpoints are created during workflow-as-agent execution
- How to combine thread conversation history with workflow checkpointing
- How to resume a workflow-as-agent from a checkpoint

Key concepts:
- Thread (AgentSession): Maintains conversation history across agent invocations
- Checkpoint: Persists workflow execution state for pause/resume capability
- These are complementary: sessions track conversation, checkpoints track workflow state

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- Environment variables configured for AzureOpenAIResponsesClient
