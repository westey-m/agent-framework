    The predicate is deliberately conservative because the result is used as a

    * Rejecting non-ASCII avoids Unicode normalization folding (macOS APFS and

      by default, so ``A`` and ``a`` would be one directory entry). Uppercase
      values are encoded rather than lowercased, because lowercasing ``A`` would
      collide with a genuine ``a``.

    This is the single derivation used everywhere an identifier that participates
    in an isolation boundary (a session ID, an owner ID, a memory scope) is turned
    into a storage location. Callers must not pre-normalize the value: a general
    path canonicalizer is lossy, and identifiers that differ only in separators or
    surrounding whitespace would then share one storage namespace.

    The derivation has three branches:

    * Literal-safe values are returned verbatim, so on-disk layouts stay readable.
    * Everything else is encoded under ``encoded_prefix`` using lowercase base32.
      This branch is **injective**: base32 is exactly reversible, and its alphabet
      (``a``-``z`` and ``2``-``7``) is case-stable, so the mapping stays one-to-one
      even on a case-insensitive filesystem. The literal and encoded namespaces
      cannot overlap because :func:`_is_literal_storage_key_segment_safe` rejects
      every value starting with ``~``, which each ``encoded_prefix`` begins with.
    * Past :data:`_MAX_ENCODED_STORAGE_KEY_SEGMENT_LENGTH` the encoding is replaced
      by a SHA-256 digest so the segment stays within filesystem name limits. This
      branch maps an unbounded input space onto 256 bits, so it is
      **collision-resistant** rather than injective: distinct identifiers sharing a
      namespace requires finding a SHA-256 collision.

    Args:
        value: The opaque identifier to convert.

    Keyword Args:
        encoded_prefix: Component-specific prefix applied to encoded values, so
            that two components encoding the same identifier stay distinguishable.
            Must start with ``~`` to stay outside the literal namespace.

    Returns:
        A single path segment containing no path separators.
