# Agent Framework TypeSafe AI

Use [TypeSafe AI](https://docs.typesafe.ai/) System One models, including Jev,
with Microsoft Agent Framework.

This alpha package adapts TypeSafe's structured decision API to the Agent Framework
chat client contract. Jev evaluates
[application state](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/state.md) against explicit
[typed questions](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives.md) and returns
probabilities and scores. It does not generate ordinary chat text.

## Installation

```bash
pip install agent-framework-typesafe --pre
```

## Quick start

Set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, then create TypeSafe questions and run them through an
Agent Framework `Agent`:

```python
from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework_typesafe import TypeSafeChatClient
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul

client = TypeSafeChatClient()
try:
    agent = Agent(
        client=client,
        name="TicketEvaluator",
        instructions="Evaluate the support request using the configured questions.",
    )
    response = await agent.run(
        "Our checkout has failed for three days and we are losing sales.",
        options={
            "response_format": {
                "department": Choice(
                    instructions="Which team should handle this request?",
                    criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None, "sales": None},
                ),
                "urgent": Noul(instructions="Does this request need urgent attention?"),
            },
        },
    )
    print(response.value)
finally:
    await client.close()
```

For this connector, Agent Framework's `response_format` option is the TypeSafe
[`Questions`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/types/questions.md)
mapping. The connector forwards it as the SDK's `questions` argument and
internally uses
[`SystemOneResponse`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/types/responses.md)
as the actual response model.

`AgentLoopMiddleware.with_judge(...)` supports provider-specific structured
judges through its `response_format` and `verdict_parser` arguments. Pass a
TypeSafe `Questions` mapping as the response format and convert the returned
`SystemOneResponse` into the framework's `JudgeVerdict` in the loop setup. This
keeps the connector focused on TypeSafe response primitives instead of making
it aware of framework-specific judge models.

Framework integrations with a fixed TypeSafe contract can configure
`default_questions` on the client and omit per-call `response_format`. For
example, `SecureAgentConfig` can use
`TypeSafeChatClient(default_questions=quarantine_questions)` directly as its
quarantine client; the framework's explicit `tool_choice="none"` forwarding is
honored.

## Supported options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `response_format` | Required non-empty TypeSafe `Questions` mapping containing `Noul`, `Choice`, or `Score` questions. |
| `model` | Optional per-call model override. |
| `instructions` | Agent instructions included in the structured state sent to TypeSafe. |

Streaming, non-text message content, and generative settings such as `temperature`
are rejected.

`TypeSafeChatClient` is the recommended client and layers function invocation,
middleware, and telemetry over `RawTypeSafeChatClient`. Use the raw client only
when composing a custom layer stack or intentionally opting out of those framework
layers. The raw client can inspect compatible tools and emit Agent Framework
function calls, but it does not execute them itself.

## Function calling

TypeSafe converts tool selection and supported arguments into internal `Choice`
and `Noul` questions, emits Agent Framework function calls, and lets the standard
function-invocation loop execute them. The client defaults to one tool call per
run; opt into sequential round trips with
`function_invocation_configuration={"max_function_calls": N}`. Jev can select
another tool call after seeing each result, or select no tool to finish.

This follows TypeSafe's
[Function calling cookbook](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/function_calling.md):
the model selects from closed sets, while application code owns validation and
execution.

The terminal response text consolidates the current turn's tool results and any
final TypeSafe `Choice` or `Score` decisions. The full terminal
`SystemOneResponse`, including `Noul` answers, remains available through
`response.value`.

Supported input-schema shapes:

- Empty/zero-argument object schemas.
- Fixed `const` values.
- `enum` or Python `Literal` arguments.
- Boolean arguments.
- Arrays whose items are `enum` or `Literal` values. These are treated as
  set-like selections in schema order; duplicates and caller-defined ordering are
  not supported. Arrays with `minItems`, `maxItems`, uniqueness, prefix, or
  membership constraints are rejected because the connector cannot preserve those
  semantics. Every enum member must match the declared item type.
- Optional versions of those shapes. A separate TypeSafe question decides whether
  to omit the argument so the function's default can apply.

Required free-form strings, numbers, nested objects, general arrays, and required
nullable arguments are not supported. Schema constraints that the connector
cannot preserve, such as `allOf` on the root object, an argument, or an array
item, also exclude the entire tool. Assertion siblings beside `$ref` or nullable
`anyOf` are rejected rather than merged in a way that could broaden the schema.
A tool is excluded when any declared argument is unsupported, including optional
arguments, so invocation never falls back to an unintended default. In automatic
tool mode, unsupported tools are excluded with a warning. Required unsupported
tools fail the request.

Local tools can use inferred schemas or Pydantic input models:

```python
from typing import Literal

from agent_framework import Agent, FunctionTool
from agent_framework_typesafe import TypeSafeChatClient
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typesafe_sdk import Noul


class WeatherArguments(BaseModel):
    city: Literal["Seattle", "Paris"]
    detailed: bool


weather = FunctionTool(
    name="weather",
    description="Get weather for a supported city.",
    func=lambda city, detailed: f"Weather for {city}; detailed={detailed}",
    input_model=WeatherArguments,
)
agent = Agent(client=TypeSafeChatClient(), tools=[weather])
response = await agent.run(
    "Give me detailed Seattle weather.",
    options={"response_format": {"succeeded": Noul(instructions="Did the tool result indicate success?")}},
)
```

MCP tools are supported through `Agent`, which connects to the server and expands
discovered MCP functions into `FunctionTool` objects before TypeSafe routing:

```python
from agent_framework import Agent, MCPStdioTool
from agent_framework_typesafe import TypeSafeChatClient

mcp = MCPStdioTool(name="my-server", command="my-mcp-server")
agent = Agent(client=TypeSafeChatClient(), tools=[mcp])
```

Only discovered MCP functions whose JSON schemas fit the supported subset are
routable. Use `tool_choice.allowed_tools` to narrow large MCP servers; a request
supports at most 32 routable tools, 64 properties per tool, 64 enum members per
argument, and 128 generated internal questions. The routable-tool limit is
checked after tool-choice filtering and before any tool schemas are compiled. An
exact cumulative question budget is reserved before question objects are
constructed, so schemas that would exceed 128 questions fail without
materializing the excess. An explicitly empty `allowed_tools` list denies every
tool. Routing criteria always include the exact function name and its optional
description so identically described tools remain distinguishable.

## Configuration and lifecycle

The internally created TypeSafe SDK client reads:

- `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` - required API key.
- `TYPESAFE_DEFAULT_MODEL` - optional default model; the SDK defaults to `jev-latest`.
- `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` - optional API root override.

Constructor values take precedence over an explicitly selected `.env` file and
process environment variables. Credential requirements are evaluated only after
those sources are resolved. When `async_client` is supplied, the injected client
is authoritative and no API key, endpoint, or environment-resolved model is
applied by the connector. An explicitly passed per-request or constructor `model`
can still override the injected client's default.

For advanced SDK configuration, inject a configured `AsyncTypeSafeClient`:

```python
from agent_framework_typesafe import TypeSafeChatClient
from typesafe_sdk import AsyncTypeSafeClient

sdk_client = AsyncTypeSafeClient(timeout=60)
client = TypeSafeChatClient(async_client=sdk_client)
```

Injected SDK clients remain caller-owned. Use `close()` or `async with` to close
clients created by `TypeSafeChatClient`.

See the [package sample](samples/README.md) for a runnable direct-client and Agent example.
