"""
Sample: Build a concurrent workflow orchestration and wrap it as an agent.

This script wires up a fan-out/fan-in workflow using `ConcurrentBuilder`, and then
invokes the entire orchestration through the `workflow.as_agent(...)` interface so
downstream coordinators can reuse the orchestration as a single agent.

Demonstrates:
- Fan-out to multiple agents, fan-in aggregation of final ChatMessages.
- Reusing the orchestrated workflow as an agent entry point with `workflow.as_agent(...)`.
- Workflow completion when idle with no pending work

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- Azure OpenAI access configured for AzureOpenAIResponsesClient (use az login + env vars)
- Familiarity with Workflow events (WorkflowEvent with type "output")
