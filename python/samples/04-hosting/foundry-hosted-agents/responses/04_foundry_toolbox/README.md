# What this sample demonstrates

An [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) agent that uses **Foundry Toolbox** for tool discovery and hosted using the **Responses protocol**. Foundry Toolbox is a managed tool registry in Microsoft Foundry that lets you define tools centrally and share them across agents.

## Creating a Foundry Toolbox

You can create a Foundry Toolbox by code. Refer to this sample for an example: [Foundry Toolbox CRUD Sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects/samples/hosted_agents/sample_toolboxes_crud.py).

You can also create a Foundry Toolbox in the Foundry portal. Read more about it [in the Foundry toolbox documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/tools/toolbox).

> If you set up a project with this sample and provision the resources using `azd provision`, a Foundry Toolbox will be created with the specified tools in [`agent.manifest.yaml`](agent.manifest.yaml).

## How It Works

### Model Integration

The agent uses `FoundryChatClient` from the Agent Framework to create an OpenAI-compatible Responses client. It loads a named Foundry Toolbox via `client.get_toolbox(name)` — the toolbox is a server-side bundle of tool configurations (e.g., `code_interpreter`, `web_search`) defined in the Foundry portal or by `azd provision`. Omitting `version` resolves the toolbox's current default version at runtime.

The sample then narrows the toolbox to a subset of tool types via `select_toolbox_tools(toolbox, include_types=[...])` before handing it to the agent. This demonstrates how one toolbox can be reused across agents that each expose only the tools they need — here, the agent only sees `code_interpreter` even though the toolbox also includes `web_search`.

See [main.py](main.py) for the full implementation.

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) with the `ResponsesHostServer`, which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol.

## Running the Agent Host

Follow the instructions in the [Running the Agent Host Locally](../../README.md#running-the-agent-host-locally) section of the README in the parent directory to run the agent host.

## Interacting with the agent

> Depending on how you run the agent host, you can invoke the agent using `curl` (`Invoke-WebRequest` in PowerShell) or `azd`. Please refer to the [parent README](../../README.md) for more details. Use this README for sample queries you can send to the agent.

Send a POST request to the server with a JSON body containing an `"input"` field to interact with the agent. For example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "What tools do you have?"}'
```

## Deploying the Agent to Foundry

To host the agent on Foundry, follow the instructions in the [Deploying the Agent to Foundry](../../README.md#deploying-the-agent-to-foundry) section of the README in the parent directory.
