Sample: Workflow as Agent with Session Conversation History and Checkpointing

This sample demonstrates how to use AgentSession with a workflow wrapped as an agent
to maintain conversation history across multiple invocations. When using as_agent(),
the session's history is included in each workflow run, enabling
the workflow participants to reference prior conversation context.

It also demonstrates how to enable checkpointing for workflow execution state
persistence, allowing workflows to be paused and resumed.

Key concepts:
- Workflows can be wrapped as agents using workflow.as_agent()
- AgentSession preserves conversation history
- Each call to agent.run() includes session history + new message
- Participants in the workflow see the full conversation context
- checkpoint_storage parameter enables workflow state persistence

Use cases:
- Multi-turn conversations with workflow-based orchestrations
- Stateful workflows that need context from previous interactions
- Building conversational agents that leverage workflow patterns
- Long-running workflows that need pause/resume capability

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- Environment variables configured for AzureOpenAIResponsesClient
