    Plain ``async for update in agent.run(...): if event.is_set(): break`` only observes ``event``
    once ``run()`` actually yields an item -- if it's suspended on a single slow model or tool call
    with no intermediate item, the signal is invisible until that call resolves. This drives the
    wrapped iterator from a single persistent background task and races each produced item against
    ``events`` via ``asyncio.wait`` instead, so a signal is observed immediately.

    The background task (``_drive``) is required (rather than spawning a fresh task per step)
    because some cleanup run by the wrapped iterator (e.g. observability span teardown) resets a
    contextvar token set on an earlier call and requires every call against it to share the same
    async context.

    If an event and a new item becomes ready at the same time, the event takes priority and the item
    is discarded. Cancelling the background task while it's mid-call is also what actually interrupts
    a suspended model/tool call, since ``ResponseStream`` (what ``SupportsAgentRun.run(stream=True)``
    returns) has no ``aclose()`` of its own.

    Callers MUST drive this through ``contextlib.aclosing`` (or an equivalent try/finally calling
    ``aclose()``): ``__anext__`` only cancels the driver task on its own signalled/exhausted paths, so
    if the consumer of ``async for`` raises instead (e.g. while processing a yielded item), the driver
    task -- and the real agent/workflow run it's pumping -- would otherwise be silently abandoned.

               When resiliency is enabled, and the server crashes mid-response:
