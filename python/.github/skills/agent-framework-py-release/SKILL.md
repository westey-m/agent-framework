description: Use when cutting a Python release for the microsoft/agent-framework monorepo. Triggers on "bump py versions", "cut a python release", "prepare release PR for python", "release py packages", "bump python to X.Y.Z", or similar requests to bump Python package versions and prepare a release PR. Handles all four lifecycle tiers (alpha, beta, rc, released) with CHANGELOG-driven selective bumps, floor bound checks, and post-bump validation.

# Agent Framework Python Release

Cuts a Python release PR for the `microsoft/agent-framework` monorepo.

## Core principle: CHANGELOG drives bumps

**No more universal lockstep.** A package only bumps if it has a CHANGELOG entry this cycle. Draft the CHANGELOG first, then derive the bump list from it.

Exceptions to selective bumping (these stay coupled regardless of per-package changes):

- **Root `agent-framework` is coupled to `agent-framework-core` via `agent-framework-core[all]==X.Y.Z`** (exact pin in `python/pyproject.toml`). If `core` bumps, root bumps. Root may also bump independently for its own changes (docs/metadata/extras).
- **Beta-tier cohort bumps are still allowed** when the user explicitly wants a fresh date stamp across all betas for cohort signaling — but this is a deliberate user decision per release, not a default.

If the user explicitly states which packages to bump (or hands over a PR list per package), treat that as authoritative.

## Lifecycle tiers and version rules

Use `python/.github/skills/python-package-management/SKILL.md` as the source of truth for lifecycle
version patterns, date-stamp cutoffs, classifier alignment, and internal dependency updates.

For release work, derive the live tier map at release time from `python/PACKAGE_STATUS.md` and the actual
`version =` lines in each `pyproject.toml`. Do not hardcode counts — packages move between tiers.

## Inputs to confirm before bumping

1. **The changeset**: explicit commits/PRs the release covers, OR derive from `git log ${LAST_RELEASED_TAG}..${RELEASE_BASE} -- python/`.
2. **Per-package CHANGELOG entries**: which packages will get a line in the new release section. This list IS the bump list.
3. **Per-released-package semver bump**: for each released-tier package that has a CHANGELOG entry, decide PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR.
4. **Date stamp** (only if any alpha/beta is being bumped): default from the `python-package-management`
   date-stamp rule.
5. **Optional cohort bump?**: ask if betas should all get a new date stamp regardless of per-package changes. Default: no.

If the user states target versions or a date explicitly, use exactly what they said — do not "correct" based on historical timezones.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **CHANGELOG-driven bumps**: only packages mentioned in the new CHANGELOG section get version bumps. Exceptions: root follows core (==pin); user-opted cohort bump on betas.
- **Follow `python-package-management` for package lifecycle and versioning rules** — do not duplicate those
  rules in this release workflow.
- **No `Co-Authored-By` trailer** on any commit.
- **Use `uv run`** for all Python/poe commands (`uv run poe ...`, `uv run pytest ...`).
- **Never rename an existing CHANGELOG section header** during a new release cut. Only INSERT a new section above existing ones.
- **Footer reference links are part of the CHANGELOG edit**, not optional.

## Workflow

### 1. Orient and create branch

```bash
git fetch origin main --tags --quiet
git fetch upstream main --tags --quiet 2>/dev/null || true
git status

# Fork clones use upstream/main as the authoritative release base; direct clones use origin/main.
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/upstream/main; then
  RELEASE_BASE=upstream/main
else
  RELEASE_BASE=origin/main
fi
git log -1 --oneline "$RELEASE_BASE"
```

If the user already has a `bump-py-ver-release-*` branch checked out, use it. Otherwise:

```bash
git checkout -b bump-py-ver-release-YYMMDD "$RELEASE_BASE"
```

### 2. Build the live tier map

Read `python/PACKAGE_STATUS.md` to enumerate current packages and lifecycle stages, and `grep '^version' python/pyproject.toml python/packages/*/pyproject.toml` to confirm actual versions. Cross-reference — if `PACKAGE_STATUS.md` shows a package as `beta` but its version looks like `1.0.0aYYMMDD`, surface the inconsistency before proceeding.

Watch for: new packages added since the last release, lifecycle transitions (alpha→beta, beta→rc, rc→released), and stale packages that haven't been touched in many cycles.

### 3. Identify changeset

Use the LATEST released tag as the compare base:

```bash
LAST_RELEASED_TAG=$(
  git tag -l 'python-[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*' \
    | uv run --directory python python -c 'import sys; tags=[t.strip() for t in sys.stdin if t.strip()]; print(max(tags, key=lambda t: tuple(map(int, t[7:].split(".")))))'
)
echo "Compare base: $LAST_RELEASED_TAG"
```

List commits and packages touched:

```bash
git log --oneline ${LAST_RELEASED_TAG}..${RELEASE_BASE} -- python/ ':!python/CHANGELOG.md'

# Per-commit package footprint
for sha in $(git log --format='%H' ${LAST_RELEASED_TAG}..${RELEASE_BASE} -- python/); do
  echo "--- $(git show -s --format='%h %s' $sha) ---"
  git show --name-only --format='' $sha | grep '^python/packages/' | \
    sed 's|^python/packages/||' | awk -F/ '{print $1}' | sort -u
done
```

When both remotes exist, record whether the fork is behind the authoritative base:

```bash
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...upstream/main
```

If user provides an explicit commit/PR list, treat THAT as authoritative.

#### 3a. Build the authoritative touched-package set

Aggregate the per-commit footprint into a single union across the whole range. This is the **source of truth** for what must appear in the CHANGELOG. Save it before drafting entries.

```bash
# Union of all touched package directories across the range
git log --name-only --format='' ${LAST_RELEASED_TAG}..${RELEASE_BASE} -- python/packages/ \
  | grep '^python/packages/' \
  | sed 's|^python/packages/||' \
  | awk -F/ '{print $1}' \
  | sort -u

# Root-level files (drive a root agent-framework entry if substantive)
git log --name-only --format='' ${LAST_RELEASED_TAG}..${RELEASE_BASE} \
  -- python/pyproject.toml python/agent_framework_meta/ python/README.md \
  2>/dev/null | grep -v '^$' | sort -u
```

**What "touched" means for bump purposes** (apply judgment, document in commit message):

| Change scope under `python/packages/<pkg>/` | Drives a bump? |
| --- | --- |
| Source code under `<pkg>/agent_framework_*` or the package's library tree | **Yes** — ship-affecting |
| `pyproject.toml` (deps, classifiers, extras, version metadata) | **Yes** — publishes new metadata |
| `README.md` substantive changes (env vars, install instructions, usage) | **Yes** — user-facing |
| `README.md` typo/wording-only | Judgment — usually no, but record under `### Changed` if you do bump |
| Tests only (`tests/`) | Usually no — test changes don't ship to PyPI consumers. Bump only if the test change reflects a real behavior change in the package |
| Package-local samples (alpha packages only, before promotion) | **Yes** for alpha; samples ship with the alpha package |
| Repo infra touching the package dir (CI config, lint config) | No — record under `- **tests**:`, `- **samples**:`, or `- **docs**:` instead |

Root `agent-framework` is touched when `python/pyproject.toml`, `python/agent_framework_meta/`, or root `README.md` substantive content changed.

### 4. Draft CHANGELOG entries (THIS DRIVES THE BUMP LIST)

Locate `## [Unreleased]` and the top existing release header. INSERT a new section between them.

**New section structure:**

```markdown
## [<release-label>] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- **agent-framework-<pkg>**: <subject> ([#NNNN](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/NNNN))

### Changed
- **agent-framework-<pkg>**: ...

### Fixed
- **agent-framework-<pkg>**: ...
```

`<release-label>` is the released-tier target if any released package is bumping (e.g. `1.7.0`), or the date stamp (e.g. `1.0.0b260528`) if the release is prerelease-only. Reflect the user's framing.

**Categorization heuristics (read commit subject + PR title/body):**
- **Added**: new public APIs, new packages, new samples, `feat(...)`, new re-exports from `agent_framework`, new capabilities surfaced from underlying SDKs
- **Changed**: metadata/classifier corrections, dependency upgrades, test infra changes, signature adjustments on existing APIs, renames, doc updates, lifecycle transitions
- **Fixed**: `fix(...)`, bug/crash/regression repairs, noise reduction (e.g. stop emitting spurious warnings), protocol-compliance fixes
- **Removed**: deprecations/deletions (use `[BREAKING]` prefix if breaking)

**Entry format:**
- `- **agent-framework-<pkg>**: <subject, grammar-normalized> ([#NNNN](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/NNNN))`
- Multiple packages touched by one PR: comma-separated bold names at the head: `- **agent-framework-core**, **agent-framework-foundry**: ...`
- Root package changes: use `- **agent-framework**: ...`
- Test/sample/repo infra: `- **tests**: ...`, `- **samples**: ...`, `- **docs**: ...` (these do not drive package bumps)

**Once entries are drafted, the set of `**agent-framework-<pkg>**` and root `**agent-framework**` mentions IS the bump list.** Anything not mentioned does not bump.

#### 4a. Reconcile mentions against the touched-package set (DO NOT SKIP)

Before moving on, prove that every ship-affecting touched package has at least one CHANGELOG entry. A package whose code changed but is missing from CHANGELOG will NOT bump — and the fix will not ship to PyPI consumers.

```bash
# 1. Touched ship-affecting packages and root package files (from step 3a)
TOUCHED_PACKAGES=$(git log --name-only --format='' ${LAST_RELEASED_TAG}..${RELEASE_BASE} -- python/packages/ \
  | grep '^python/packages/' \
  | sed 's|^python/packages/||' \
  | awk -F/ '{print $1}' \
  | sort -u)

ROOT_TOUCHED=$(git log --name-only --format='' ${LAST_RELEASED_TAG}..${RELEASE_BASE} \
  -- python/pyproject.toml python/agent_framework_meta/ python/README.md \
  2>/dev/null | grep -v '^$' | sort -u)

TOUCHED=$(
  {
    if [ -n "$TOUCHED_PACKAGES" ]; then echo "$TOUCHED_PACKAGES"; fi
    if [ -n "$ROOT_TOUCHED" ]; then echo "agent-framework"; fi
  } | sort -u
)

# 2. Packages mentioned in the new CHANGELOG section
# (Extract from the section you just drafted — adjust the awk range to the new section's bounds)
MENTIONED=$(awk '
  /^## \[<release-label>\]/ { in_section=1; next }
  in_section && /^## \[/ { exit }
  in_section { print }
' python/CHANGELOG.md \
  | grep -oE '\*\*agent-framework(-[a-z0-9_-]+)?\*\*' \
  | sed 's/\*\*//g;s/^agent-framework-//' \
  | sort -u)

# 3. Diff — anything in TOUCHED but missing from MENTIONED is a gap
comm -23 <(echo "$TOUCHED") <(echo "$MENTIONED")
```

For every gap, decide explicitly with the user:

- **Add a CHANGELOG entry and bump** — the default. Even small package changes (a dep upgrade, a metadata fix) deserve an entry under `### Changed`.
- **Intentionally skip** — only when the touched files are demonstrably non-shipping (e.g. comments-only, test infra). Note the skip in the commit message body so reviewers see the reasoning.

Package-name aliasing to watch for: directory `foundry_local` → package `agent-framework-foundry-local`; `github_copilot` → `agent-framework-github-copilot`; `azure-ai-search` → `agent-framework-azure-ai-search`. The directory name and the published PyPI name are not always identical — confirm both when reconciling.

**Footer reference links** (REQUIRED every release):

```bash
grep -n "^\[.*\]:" python/CHANGELOG.md | head -5
```

Two edits when a released-tier bump is in play:
1. Advance `[Unreleased]` compare base from `python-${OLD_RELEASED}...HEAD` to `python-${NEW_RELEASED}...HEAD`.
2. INSERT a new `[${NEW_RELEASED}]` line ABOVE the previous version's link: `[${NEW_RELEASED}]: https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/compare/python-${OLD_RELEASED}...python-${NEW_RELEASED}`

For prerelease-only releases (no released-tier bump this cycle), footer links don't change.

### 5. Apply bumps per tier

For each package in the bump list, choose the rule for its current tier. Use anchored `sed` (`^version = "..."$`) so only the project's own version matches. Use `sed -i.bak` plus backup cleanup for portable in-place edits across macOS/BSD sed and GNU sed.

**Released tier (per-package semver):**

```bash
# Example: openai goes 1.6.0 -> 1.6.1 (PATCH); core stays
sed -i.bak 's/^version = "1.6.0"$/version = "1.6.1"/' python/packages/openai/pyproject.toml
rm python/packages/openai/pyproject.toml.bak
```

**Root `agent-framework` (only when `core` bumps, OR for its own changes):**

```bash
sed -i.bak "s/^version = \"${OLD_ROOT}\"$/version = \"${NEW_ROOT}\"/" python/pyproject.toml
# AND keep the exact pin in sync with core
sed -i.bak "s/agent-framework-core\\[all\\]==${OLD_CORE}/agent-framework-core[all]==${NEW_CORE}/" python/pyproject.toml
rm python/pyproject.toml.bak
```

**RC tier (counter increment):**

```bash
# ag-ui goes 1.0.0rc3 -> 1.0.0rc4 only because it has a CHANGELOG entry
sed -i.bak 's/^version = "1.0.0rc3"$/version = "1.0.0rc4"/' python/packages/ag-ui/pyproject.toml
rm python/packages/ag-ui/pyproject.toml.bak
```

**Alpha/Beta tier (new date stamp):**

```bash
OLD_DATE=260521
NEW_DATE=260528

# Only the packages with CHANGELOG entries get the new stamp.
# Example: anthropic and bedrock had entries, others did not.
for pkg in anthropic bedrock; do
  file="python/packages/$pkg/pyproject.toml"
  sed -i.bak "s/1\\.0\\.0b${OLD_DATE}/1.0.0b${NEW_DATE}/g" "$file"
  rm "${file}.bak"
done
```

If the user opts into a cohort-wide beta bump regardless of per-package changes, enumerate every beta package from `PACKAGE_STATUS.md` and stamp all of them. State that this is a cohort bump in the commit message.

Spot-check with `grep '^version' python/pyproject.toml python/packages/*/pyproject.toml | sort` before moving on.

### 6. Floor bound updates on `agent-framework-core`

Only relevant when `core` itself bumped this cycle. Two policies, pick one explicitly with the user:

- **Conservative (default)**: raise `agent-framework-core>=X.Y.Z` to the new core version on every non-core package that is ALSO bumping this cycle. Leaves packages-not-bumped at their existing floor.
- **Strict per-upstream-doc**: only raise the floor on packages that actually consume a new core API introduced in the bump. This requires per-package code inspection because release probes use the co-released local core and cannot prove compatibility with an older published core floor.

When raising a core floor, replace only the `>=OLD` half of the bound you intend to change:

```bash
file="python/packages/<pkg>/pyproject.toml"
sed -i.bak "s/agent-framework-core>=${OLD_CORE}/agent-framework-core>=${NEW_CORE}/" "$file"
rm "${file}.bak"
```

If `core` did not bump this cycle, do not touch floors.

### 7. Validate

```bash
cd python && uv run poe validate-python-release --base-ref "$RELEASE_BASE"
```

Use the same freshly fetched main ref that the release branch was based on (`upstream/main` above; use `origin/main`
when that is the authoritative release base). Must exit 0. This task first regenerates `uv.lock`, then discovers the
package `pyproject.toml` files changed from that base and runs their published runtime dependencies and
non-development extras through lock-independent `lowest-direct` and `highest` import probes. The probes run in
parallel, derive the minimum supported Python minor from each package's internal editable closure, and share a hard
300-second deadline. Use `--python` only when the release requires an explicit interpreter override.

This is the release safety net for selective bumping: the lower probe catches unresolvable or unimportable external
floors, internal constraints that reject co-released package versions, and the upper probe catches caps that exclude
an installable package set. The JSON report records the concrete versions resolved in both scenarios. It does not
replace the package-by-package code inspection required by the strict core-floor policy. If it fails, fix the named
package/bound and re-run before committing.

Do not substitute the workspace-wide `validate-dependency-bounds-test` command here. That command runs every
package's full tests and Pyright in separate isolated environments and is intentionally reserved for CI or an
explicit dependency-range audit. If the release itself changes an external dependency range, also run
`validate-dependency-bounds-project --mode both --package <pkg> --dependency <name>` for that dependency.

If only prereleases changed (no `core` bump, no floor changes), release validation is still required because the
lockfile and both ends of each changed package's published dependency metadata must remain installable.

### 8. Commit (expect hook retry)

The project's pre-commit hook runs `poe check` / `poe typing` / `uv lock` and may re-modify `uv.lock` on first commit attempt. Expected pattern — run twice:

```bash
git add -u
git commit -m "<message>"   # may fail with "files were modified by this hook"
git add -u                  # re-stage hook-generated changes
git commit -m "<message>"   # succeeds
```

**Commit message format** — HEREDOC, no `Co-Authored-By`:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Bump Python package versions for <release-label> release

<One paragraph explaining:
 - which packages bumped and why (CHANGELOG-driven)
 - semver rationale for any released-tier bumps
 - whether a beta cohort bump was applied
 - whether core floors were raised, and under which policy>
EOF
)"
```

### 9. Push and report

```bash
git push origin bump-py-ver-release-YYMMDD
```

The push output includes a `Create a pull request for '<branch>' on GitHub by visiting: <URL>` line — surface that to the user.

## Pitfalls from past cycles — avoid repeating

- **Scoping from the wrong tag.** A release may have been tagged between bump cycles. Always compute `LAST_RELEASED_TAG` fresh — do NOT reuse the previous compare base. Symptom: dragging already-shipped PRs into the new CHANGELOG section.
- **Bumping packages that had no changes.** This was the old lockstep default. Now: a package without a CHANGELOG entry does not bump. The two exceptions (root follows core, optional beta cohort bump) are explicit choices, not defaults.
- **Touched package missing from CHANGELOG.** The inverse failure mode of the previous pitfall, and the dangerous one. If a PR landed code into `python/packages/foo/` but the new CHANGELOG section has no `**agent-framework-foo**:` line, then `foo` will NOT bump, and the fix sits in `main` but never reaches PyPI. Always run the touched-vs-mentioned reconciliation in step 4a before applying bumps.
- **Directory name vs PyPI name confusion.** Some package dirs use underscores or split names that differ from the published PyPI name (e.g. `foundry_local` → `agent-framework-foundry-local`). When reconciling touched dirs against CHANGELOG mentions, normalize on the PyPI form.
- **Forgetting root when core bumps.** Root `agent-framework` has `agent-framework-core[all]==EXACT_VERSION`. If `core` bumps and root does not, the pin is broken. Always bump them together and update the pin string.
- **Renaming an existing section header.** When drafting a new release, do NOT rewrite an existing `## [X.Y.Z]` header to a new label — that wipes the historical section. Always INSERT a new section above.
- **Forgetting footer reference links.** When a released-tier bump is in play, the `[Unreleased]` line and the new `[X.Y.Z]` link at the bottom MUST be updated. Heading links don't resolve without them.
- **Wrong footer compare base.** The new `[X.Y.Z]` line compares from the PREVIOUS released tag, not from two releases ago.
- **Timezone drift.** For alpha/beta date stamps, follow the `python-package-management` date-stamp rule;
  do not infer a local timezone from the user's current shell.
- **`Co-Authored-By` trailer.** Never add it. Rewrite/amend if it slipped in.
- **Stale inventory in this skill.** Always read `python/PACKAGE_STATUS.md` for the live tier map. Do not trust a hardcoded list.
- **Divergent origin vs upstream.** In fork clones, use freshly fetched `upstream/main` consistently for branch creation, changeset discovery, and release validation. A stale `origin/main` must never become the implicit compare base.
- **`--pre` README cleanup on promotion.** When a package is promoted to `released` in this cycle, grep for `pip install agent-framework-<pkg> --pre` in READMEs and drop the `--pre` flag.
- **RC counter inflation.** Do not increment `1.0.0rcN` without a CHANGELOG entry for that package. The counter tracks iterations, not calendar.
