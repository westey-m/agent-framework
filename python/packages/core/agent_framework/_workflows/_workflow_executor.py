class WorkflowExecutor(Executor):
    """An executor that wraps a workflow to enable hierarchical workflow composition.

    ## Overview
    WorkflowExecutor makes a workflow behave as a single executor within a parent workflow,
    enabling nested workflow architectures. It handles the complete lifecycle of sub-workflow
    execution including event processing, output forwarding, and request/response coordination
    between parent and child workflows.

    ## Execution Model
    When invoked, WorkflowExecutor:
    1. Starts the wrapped workflow with the input message
    2. Runs the sub-workflow to completion or until it needs external input
    3. Processes the sub-workflow's complete event stream after execution
    4. Forwards outputs to the parent workflow as messages
    5. Handles external requests by routing them to the parent workflow
    6. Accumulates responses and resumes sub-workflow execution

    ## Event Stream Processing
    WorkflowExecutor processes events after sub-workflow completion:

    ### Output Forwarding
    All outputs from the sub-workflow are automatically forwarded to the parent:

    #### When `allow_direct_output` is False (default):

    .. code-block:: python

        # An executor in the sub-workflow yields outputs
        await ctx.yield_output("sub-workflow result")

        # WorkflowExecutor forwards to parent via ctx.send_message()
        # Parent receives the output as a regular message

    #### When `allow_direct_output` is True:

    .. code-block:: python
        # An executor in the sub-workflow yields outputs
        await ctx.yield_output("sub-workflow result")

        # WorkflowExecutor yields output directly to parent workflow's event stream
        # The output of the sub-workflow is considered the output of the parent workflow
        # Caller of the parent workflow receives the output directly

    ### Request/Response Coordination
    When sub-workflows need external information:

    .. code-block:: python

        # An executor in the sub-workflow makes request
        request = MyDataRequest(query="user info")

        # WorkflowExecutor captures WorkflowEvent and wraps it in a SubWorkflowRequestMessage
        # then send it to the receiving executor in parent workflow. The executor in parent workflow
        # can handle the request locally or forward it to an external source.
        # The WorkflowExecutor tracks the pending request, and implements a response handler.
        # When the response is received, it executes the response handler to accumulate responses
        # and resume the sub-workflow when all expected responses are received.
        # The response handler expects a SubWorkflowResponseMessage wrapping the response data.

    ### State Management
    WorkflowExecutor keeps no request/response bookkeeping of its own. The wrapped sub-workflow
    is the single source of truth for its pending requests; responses are forwarded to it and
    validated against its own pending request_info events.

    ## Type System Integration
    WorkflowExecutor inherits its type signature from the wrapped workflow:

    ### Input Types
    Matches the wrapped workflow's start executor input types:

    .. code-block:: python

        # If sub-workflow accepts str, WorkflowExecutor accepts str
        workflow_executor = WorkflowExecutor(my_workflow, id="wrapper")
        assert workflow_executor.input_types == my_workflow.input_types

    ### Output Types
    Combines sub-workflow outputs with request coordination types:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Includes all sub-workflow output types
        # Plus SubWorkflowRequestMessage if sub-workflow can make requests
        output_types = workflow.output_types + [SubWorkflowRequestMessage]  # if applicable

    ## Error Handling
    WorkflowExecutor propagates sub-workflow failures:
    - Captures failed event (type='failed') from sub-workflow
    - Converts to error event in parent context
    - Provides detailed error information including sub-workflow ID

    ## Overlapping Executions
    A ``WorkflowExecutor`` wraps a single shared sub-workflow instance and keeps no per-execution
    state. If a new input arrives while the sub-workflow still has pending request_info events from
    an unfinished request/response cycle, the new input advances the shared sub-workflow state and
    can interfere with that cycle - a response arriving later may apply to a sub-workflow that has
    moved on. This is allowed but logs a warning, and is only safe when the wrapped workflow (and
    its executors) are stateless.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Avoid: stateful executor whose instance variables are shared across overlapping runs
        class StatefulExecutor(Executor):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(id="stateful")
                self.data = []  # Shared across overlapping sub-workflow executions!

    ## Integration with Parent Workflows
    Parent workflows can intercept sub-workflow requests:

    .. code-block:: python
        class ParentExecutor(Executor):
            @handler
            async def handle_subworkflow_request(
                self,
                request: SubWorkflowRequestMessage,
                ctx: WorkflowContext[SubWorkflowResponseMessage],
            ) -> None:
                # Handle request locally or forward to external source
                if self.can_handle_locally(request):
                    # Send response back to sub-workflow
                    response = request.create_response(data="local response data")
                    await ctx.send_message(response, target_id=request.source_executor_id)
                else:
                    # Forward to external handler
                    await ctx.request_info(request.source_event, response_type=request.source_event.response_type)

    ## Checkpointing
    The provided sub workflow may not have its own checkpoint storage. The sub workflow checkpointed states will
    be managed by the parent workflow.

    ## Implementation Notes
    - Sub-workflows run to completion (or to idle-with-pending-requests) before their results are processed
    - Event processing is ordered - outputs are forwarded before requests
    - Responses are forwarded to the sub-workflow as they arrive; the sub-workflow tracks its own
      pending requests and resumes when they are answered
    - The WorkflowExecutor keeps no per-execution bookkeeping; the sub-workflow is the single source
      of truth for its pending requests. Starting a new execution while the sub-workflow still has
      pending requests logs a warning and is only safe when the wrapped workflow is stateless
