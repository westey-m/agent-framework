Sample: Handoff Workflow with Tool Approvals + Checkpoint Resume

Demonstrates resuming a handoff workflow from a checkpoint while handling both
HandoffAgentUserRequest prompts and function approval request Content for tool calls
(e.g., submit_refund).

Scenario:
1. User starts a conversation with the workflow.
2. Agents may emit user input requests or tool approval requests.
3. Workflow writes a checkpoint capturing pending requests and pauses.
4. Process can exit/restart.
5. On resume: Restore checkpoint, inspect pending requests, then provide responses.
6. Workflow continues from the saved state.

Pattern:
- workflow.run(checkpoint_id=..., stream=True) to restore checkpoint and discover pending requests.
- workflow.run(stream=True, responses=responses) to supply human replies and approvals.
  (Two steps are needed here because the sample must inspect request types before building responses.
  When response payloads are already known, use the single-call form:
  workflow.run(stream=True, checkpoint_id=..., responses=responses).)

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- Azure CLI authentication (az login).
- Environment variables configured for AzureOpenAIResponsesClient.
