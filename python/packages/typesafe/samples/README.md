# TypeSafe AI samples

These samples need extra explanation because TypeSafe System One models return
[typed judgments](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/system-one.md) rather than
ordinary generated chat text.

## Samples

| Sample | What it demonstrates | Expected output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`jev_structured_output.py`](jev_structured_output.py) | Direct client and Agent use with Noul, Choice, and Score questions. | Department, confidence, frustration score, and urgency probability. |
| [`function_calling.py`](function_calling.py) | Sequential local tool calls followed by a final Choice comparison. | Two weather tool results, the selected better city, and Choice confidence. |
| [`mcp_function_calling.py`](mcp_function_calling.py) | MCP discovery, TypeSafe tool routing, and terminal Noul evaluation. | The MCP weather result and success probability. |
| [`mcp_weather_server.py`](mcp_weather_server.py) | The local stdio MCP server used by the MCP client sample. | MCP protocol traffic only; the client prints the user-facing result. |
| [`secure_agent_quarantine.py`](secure_agent_quarantine.py) | Jev as the `SecureAgentConfig` quarantine client for structured risk classification. | Risk label, confidence, safety probability, and propagated security labels. |
| [`agent_loop_judge.py`](agent_loop_judge.py) | `TypeSafeChatClient` passed directly to `AgentLoopMiddleware.with_judge`, with client middleware logging each evaluation and structured verdict. | The criteria, original request, latest response, and `JudgeVerdict`, followed by the final accepted answer. |

## How `response_format` works

Regular chat clients commonly use `response_format` to provide a Pydantic output
model or JSON schema. This connector instead expects a TypeSafe `Questions`
[mapping](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/types/questions.md):

```python
options = {
    "response_format": {
        "urgent": Noul(instructions="Does this need urgent attention?"),
        "department": Choice(
            instructions="Which department should handle this?",
            criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None},
        ),
        "severity": Score(
            instructions="How severe is the issue?",
            criteria=["Low", "Medium", "High"],
        ),
    }
}
```

The configured keys become answer IDs on
[`SystemOneResponse`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/types/responses.md):

| Question | Meaning | Main result fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`Noul`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/noul.md) | Probability that a statement is true or the answer is yes. | `noul` from 0 to 1. There is no separate confidence field. |
| [`Choice`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice.md) | Select one label from a closed set. | `choice`, `probabilities`, and `confidence`. |
| [`Score`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/score.md) | Rate along ordered rubric levels. | Weighted `score`, `legend`, `probabilities`, and `confidence`. |

For every sample, `response.value` is the complete typed
`SystemOneResponse`, including `answers`, the grouped `nouls`/`choices`/`scores`
views, model name, and token usage.

See the TypeSafe
[Primitives overview](https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives.md) for choosing a
question type and [Confidence](https://docs.typesafe.ai/confidence.md) for the
difference between an answer probability and confidence.

`response.text` depends on the run:

- Without tools, it is the serialized `SystemOneResponse` JSON.
- With tools, it is a convenience string containing the current turn's tool
  results followed by final `Choice` and `Score` decisions.
- `Noul` probabilities are not appended to tool-run text. Read them from
  `response.value.nouls`.

Temporary questions used internally for tool routing are removed from the final
`SystemOneResponse`.

The connector's constrained tool-routing design follows TypeSafe's
[Function calling cookbook](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/function_calling.md):
code owns execution, while Jev selects tools and closed-set arguments.

## Setup and run

Set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in `python/.env`. The Python samples also call
`load_dotenv()`, so the key is loaded when running them directly from `python/`.

Run from `python/`:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env --package agent-framework-typesafe \
    python packages/typesafe/samples/jev_structured_output.py

uv run --env-file .env --package agent-framework-typesafe \
    python packages/typesafe/samples/function_calling.py

uv run --with "mcp>=1.27.0,<2" --env-file .env --package agent-framework-typesafe \
    python packages/typesafe/samples/mcp_function_calling.py

uv run --env-file .env --package agent-framework-typesafe \
    python packages/typesafe/samples/secure_agent_quarantine.py

uv run --with agent-framework-foundry --with azure-identity \
    --env-file .env --package agent-framework-typesafe \
    python packages/typesafe/samples/agent_loop_judge.py
```

The MCP command explicitly installs the sample-only `mcp` dependency. The MCP
sample launches and closes the stdio server automatically.

The loop-judge sample also requires `agent-framework-foundry`,
`FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, `FOUNDRY_MODEL`, and an authenticated Azure CLI
session (`az login`).

Each source file contains a representative output block at the end. Jev
probabilities, confidence, random sample temperatures, and resulting comparisons
can vary between runs.

## Specialized Agent Framework roles

- **SecureAgentConfig quarantine client:** works when the quarantine task is a
  fixed structured classification. Jev cannot provide the arbitrary generated
  summaries expected from a normal quarantine LLM, so the sample passes explicit
  risk and safety questions as `TypeSafeChatClient(default_questions=...)`
  directly to `SecureAgentConfig`.
- **AgentLoopMiddleware judge:** passes `TypeSafeChatClient()` directly to
  `with_judge` while configuring the loop with a Jev Noul `response_format` and a
  `verdict_parser` that converts `SystemOneResponse` into `JudgeVerdict`. The
  client itself remains unaware of the framework judge model. Client middleware
  logs the logical criteria, original request, latest response, and returned
  verdict without exposing the framework's internal judge-prompt framing. Jev
  cannot generate the optional reasoning prose, so the parser supplies
  deterministic probability feedback. The sample also includes a commented
  opt-in configuration that deliberately withholds one requirement from the first
  answer, producing a negative verdict before a targeted retry.
