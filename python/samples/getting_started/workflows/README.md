# Workflows Getting Started Samples

## Installation

Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows support ships with the core `agent-framework` or `agent-framework-core` package, so no extra installation step is required.

To install with visualization support:

```bash
pip install agent-framework[viz] --pre
```

To export visualization images you also need to [install GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

## Samples Overview

## Foundational Concepts - Start Here

Begin with the `_start-here` folder in order. These three samples introduce the core ideas of executors, edges, agents in workflows, and streaming.

| Sample               | File                                                                                      | Concepts                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Executors and Edges  | [\_start-here/step1_executors_and_edges.py](./_start-here/step1_executors_and_edges.py)   | Minimal workflow with basic executors and edges                     |
| Agents in a Workflow | [\_start-here/step2_agents_in_a_workflow.py](./_start-here/step2_agents_in_a_workflow.py) | Introduces adding Agents as nodes; calling agents inside a workflow |
| Streaming (Basics)   | [\_start-here/step3_streaming.py](./_start-here/step3_streaming.py)                       | Extends workflows with event streaming                              |

Once comfortable with these, explore the rest of the samples below.

### resources

- Sample text inputs used by certain workflows:
  - [resources/long_text.txt](./resources/long_text.txt)
  - [resources/email.txt](./resources/email.txt)
  - [resources/spam.txt](./resources/spam.txt)
  - [resources/ambiguous_email.txt](./resources/ambiguous_email.txt)

Notes

- Agent-based samples use provider SDKs (Azure/OpenAI, etc.). Ensure credentials are configured, or adapt agents accordingly.

Sequential orchestration uses a few small adapter nodes for plumbing:

- "input-conversation" normalizes input to `list[Message]`
- "to-conversation:<participant>" converts agent responses into the shared conversation
- "complete" publishes the final output event (type='output')
  These may appear in event streams (executor_invoked/executor_completed). They're analogous to
  concurrent’s dispatcher and aggregator and can be ignored if you only care about agent activity.

### Environment Variables

Workflow samples that use `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient` expect:

- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` (Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint)
- `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` (model deployment name)

These values are passed directly into the client constructor via `os.getenv()` in sample code.
