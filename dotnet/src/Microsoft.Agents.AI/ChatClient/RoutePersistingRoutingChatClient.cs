/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This client holds multiple named inner clients (routes) and selects one per request. The route that is active
/// for a session is stored in the session's <see cref="AgentSessionStateBag"/> as an
/// <see cref="AgentSessionRoutingState"/>, so the selection survives for the lifetime of the session and across
/// session serialization. Use <see cref="SetActiveRoute"/> and <see cref="GetActiveRoute"/> to change or inspect
/// the active route for a session.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Because the conversation history is carried by the agent's session rather than by the routed client, switching
/// route mid-conversation preserves the full history for whichever client handles the next turn.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A new session starts on <see cref="RoutePersistingRoutingChatClientOptions.DefaultRoute"/>, or on the first entry of
/// the routes dictionary when no default is configured.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This client resolves the current session from <see cref="AIAgent.CurrentRunContext"/>, which is set
/// automatically when an agent's run methods are called. It must therefore be invoked within an agent run that
/// has a resolved session; invoking it outside of an agent run, or before a session is resolved, throws an
/// <see cref="InvalidOperationException"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For routing policies that are not persisted per session, such as content-based or failover routing, use the
/// routing clients provided by <c>Microsoft.Extensions.AI</c> directly.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Instances are thread-safe across different sessions as long as <see cref="Routes"/> is not modified. Route
/// mutations must only be performed when no requests are in flight. A single session must not be used concurrently,
/// since the per-session routing state assumes only one request per session is in flight at a time.
