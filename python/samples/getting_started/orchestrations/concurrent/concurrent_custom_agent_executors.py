Sample: Concurrent Orchestration with Custom Agent Executors

This sample shows a concurrent fan-out/fan-in pattern using child Executor classes
that each own their Agent. The executors accept AgentExecutorRequest inputs
and emit AgentExecutorResponse outputs, which allows reuse of the high-level
ConcurrentBuilder API and the default aggregator.

Demonstrates:
- Executors that create their Agent in __init__ (via AzureOpenAIResponsesClient)
- A @handler that converts AgentExecutorRequest -> AgentExecutorResponse
- ConcurrentBuilder(participants=[...]) to build fan-out/fan-in
- Default aggregator returning list[Message] (one user + one assistant per agent)
- Workflow completion when all participants become idle

Prerequisites:
- AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- Azure OpenAI configured for AzureOpenAIResponsesClient (az login + required env vars)

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    01 [user]:
    We are launching a new budget-friendly electric bike for urban commuters.
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    02 [researcher]:
    **Insights:**

    - **Target Demographic:** Urban commuters seeking affordable, eco-friendly transport;
        likely to include students, young professionals, and price-sensitive urban residents.
    - **Market Trends:** E-bike sales are growing globally, with increasing urbanization,
        higher fuel costs, and sustainability concerns driving adoption.
    - **Competitive Landscape:** Key competitors include brands like Rad Power Bikes, Aventon,
        Lectric, and domestic budget-focused manufacturers in North America, Europe, and Asia.
    - **Feature Expectations:** Customers expect reliability, ease-of-use, theft protection,
        lightweight design, sufficient battery range for daily city commutes (typically 25-40 miles),
        and low-maintenance components.

    **Opportunities:**

    - **First-time Buyers:** Capture newcomers to e-biking by emphasizing affordability, ease of
        operation, and cost savings vs. public transit/car ownership.
    ...
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    03 [marketer]:
    **Value Proposition:**
    "Empowering your city commute: Our new electric bike combines affordability, reliability, and
        sustainable design—helping you conquer urban journeys without breaking the bank."

    **Target Messaging:**

    *For Young Professionals:*

    **Constraints, Disclaimers, & Policy Concerns for Launching a Budget-Friendly Electric Bike for Urban Commuters:**

    **1. Regulatory Compliance**
    - Verify that the electric bike meets all applicable federal, state, and local regulations
        regarding e-bike classification, speed limits, power output, and safety features.
    - Ensure necessary certifications (e.g., UL certification for batteries, CE markings if sold internationally) are obtained.

    **2. Product Safety**
    - Include consumer safety warnings regarding use, battery handling, charging protocols, and age restrictions.
