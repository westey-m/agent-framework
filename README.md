# Microsoft Agent Framework

Highlights
- Flexible Agent Framework: build, orchestrate, and deploy AI agents and workflows
- Multi-Agent Orchestration: group chat, sequential, concurrent, and handoff patterns
- Graph-based Workflows: connect agents and deterministic functions using data flows with streaming, checkpointing, time-travel, and Human-in-the-loop.
- Plugin Ecosystem: extend with native functions, OpenAPI, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and more
- LLM Support: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry, and more
- Runtime Support: in-process and distributed agent execution
- Multimodal: text, vision, and function calling
- Cross-Platform: .NET and Python implementations

Below are the basics for each language implementation. For more details on python see [here](./python/README.md) and for .NET see [here](./dotnet/README.md).
