"""
The following sample demonstrates how to create an Azure AI agent that
uses Bing Grounding search to find real-time information from the web.

Prerequisites:
1. A connected Grounding with Bing Search resource in your Azure AI project
2. Set BING_CONNECTION_ID environment variable
   Example: BING_CONNECTION_ID="your-bing-connection-id"

To set up Bing Grounding:
1. Go to Azure AI Foundry portal (https://ai.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your project's "Connected resources" section
3. Add a new connection for "Grounding with Bing Search"
4. Copy either the connection name or ID and set the appropriate environment variable
