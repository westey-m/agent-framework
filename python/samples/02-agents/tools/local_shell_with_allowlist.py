"""
LocalShellTool with command-text filtering (no approval loop).

WARNING: This is an educational example, not a safe production configuration.
Do not copy this approval-disabled setup into production. Use only an isolated,
disposable environment without secrets or valuable data.

The allow-list checks command text, not what the shell will execute. Embedded
commands in $(...) or backticks can pass these filters and run; patterns that
only check the start of a command can also allow extra operations. These filters
do not enforce read-only access or protect against malicious model instructions.
Commands run with the application's permissions and can access or change files
and other resources available to it. Human approval and separately enforced
isolation are not replaced by an allow-list.
