"""Shared production-ready claw agent factory for Post 4.

Builds the same personal finance claw as Step 03 and adds production wiring for
observability-aware hosts plus opt-in Microsoft Purview chat policy middleware.

Environment variables:
    FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT       — Microsoft Foundry project endpoint URL
    FOUNDRY_MODEL                  — Model deployment name for local hosts (defaults to gpt-5.4)
    TOOLBOX_MCP_SERVER_URL         — Optional Foundry Toolbox MCP endpoint URL for managed skills
    PURVIEW_CLIENT_APP_ID          — Optional app/client ID; enables Purview chat policy middleware

Run indirectly through a host, for example:
    uv run python/samples/02-agents/harness/build_your_own_claw/claw_step04_production_ready/console.py

FINANCE_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
## Personal Finance Assistant Instructions

You are a personal finance and investing assistant. You help the user understand their portfolio
and watchlist, value individual stocks, gauge portfolio risk, research the market, and keep their
records tidy.

### Working style

- The user's holdings live in a file called portfolio.csv. Read it with the file_access tools
  before answering questions about their portfolio, and never modify it unless asked.
- You have skills for valuation and risk-scoring. When a question matches a skill, load it and
  follow its instructions (read its references, run its scripts) rather than guessing.
- When asked to research several tickers, delegate each one to the background research agent so
  they run concurrently, then summarize the findings together.
- The user's trade confirmations accumulate in the working/confirmations folder. When asked to tidy
  or reorganize them, use the run_shell tool: inspect the folder first, then move files into a
  year/month layout and rename them to YYYY-MM-DD_TICKER_BUY|SELL.txt. Explain your plan before
  running commands that change anything.
- To buy or sell, use the place_trade tool. This takes a real action, so the user will be asked to
  approve it before it runs — explain what you are about to do first.

### Important

You provide information and analysis only — you are not a licensed financial advisor and you must
not present your output as personalized investment advice. Remind the user to do their own
research before making decisions.

        model: Optional model deployment override.
        default_options: Optional per-agent default chat options, such as ``{"store": False}`` for hosting.
        history_provider: Optional history provider override. Hosted agents should pass
            ``InMemoryHistoryProvider(load_messages=False)`` because Responses hosting owns history.
        enable_file_access: When True (default), the agent can read and write files. Disable it on
            shared/hosted deployments where arbitrary read/write access to the container filesystem is a
            data-exfiltration and tampering risk; prefer an external ``file_access_store`` instead.
        file_access_store: Optional custom ``AgentFileStore``. When None (and ``enable_file_access`` is
            True), a ``FileSystemAgentFileStore`` rooted at the working dir is used. Supply your own — for
            example, one backed by Azure Blob Storage — to keep files off the container disk when hosted.
        file_memory_store: Optional custom ``AgentFileStore`` backing the harness file memory. When
            None, the harness default is used, which writes to ``{cwd}/agent-file-memory``. Hosted
            deployments must supply a store rooted at a writable path, because the deployed code
            directory is mounted read-only.
        enable_shell: When True (default), the agent can run shell commands. Disable it on
            shared/hosted deployments: arbitrary command execution inside the container is a serious
            security risk (data exfiltration, persistence, tampering) even behind a deny-list.
        purview_credential: Optional credential for Purview chat policy enforcement. Pass the
            container's managed identity (``DefaultAzureCredential``) on hosted deployments; when None,
            an ``InteractiveBrowserCredential`` is used for local interactive runs.
        auto_approve_skill_scripts: When True, ``run_skill_script`` is auto-approved so skills that run
            a bundled script complete without a human in the loop. Intended for unattended runs such as
            ``evals.py``; leave it False for interactive and hosted use. It only covers the skill tools —
            ``place_trade``, the shell, and file writes keep their normal approval behavior.
