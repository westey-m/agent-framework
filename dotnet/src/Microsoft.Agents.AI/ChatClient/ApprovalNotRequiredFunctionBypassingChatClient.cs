/// A delegating chat client that automatically removes <see cref="ToolApprovalRequestContent"/> for tools
/// that do not actually require approval, storing auto-approved results in the session for transparent
/// re-injection on the next request.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="FunctionInvokingChatClient"/> has an all-or-nothing behavior for approvals: when any tool
/// in a response is an <see cref="ApprovalRequiredAIFunction"/>, it converts all <see cref="FunctionCallContent"/>
/// items to <see cref="ToolApprovalRequestContent"/> — even for tools that do not require approval. This
/// decorator sits above <see cref="FunctionInvokingChatClient"/> in the pipeline and transparently handles
/// the non-approval-required items so callers only see approval requests for tools that truly need them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// On outbound responses, the decorator identifies <see cref="ToolApprovalRequestContent"/> items for tools
/// that are not wrapped in <see cref="ApprovalRequiredAIFunction"/>, removes them from the response, and
/// stores them in the session's <see cref="AgentSessionStateBag"/>. On the next inbound request, the stored
/// items are re-injected as pre-approved <see cref="ToolApprovalResponseContent"/> so that
/// <see cref="FunctionInvokingChatClient"/> can process them alongside the caller's human-approved responses.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A stored decision is only reused while the tool it refers to still does not require approval. Before
/// re-injecting, each stored item is re-checked against the tools available to the current turn. If the name
/// has since become approval-required, or has left the tool set, the stored decision is discarded and the call
/// is injected as rejected rather than approved, so that it is not executed. The decision recorded here was the
/// framework's to make only while no approval was needed; once the application asks for a human, a decision
/// taken before that cannot stand in for one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This decorator operates within the context of a running <see cref="AIAgent"/> with an active
/// <see cref="AgentRunContext.Session"/>. When invoked without an ambient run context or session
/// (for example when the chat client is used directly outside of an agent run), the decorator becomes
/// a no-op: it passes the request through to the inner client unchanged, surfacing all approval
/// requests to the caller, and logs a warning.
