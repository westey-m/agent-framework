In 1988, the WHO declared a target of similarly eliminating polio by the end of the\nmillennium. That target was missed, and the stubborn persistence of infections prompted the WHO\nto declare a PHEIC in 2014. Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made, with the number of\ncases falling by 99 % over the past three decades. Unfortunately, tuberculosis is very far from\ndisappearing; however, the WHO's Global Drug Facility has enabled millions of patients in\ndeveloping countries to access high-quality anti-TB medicines, both through collective purchasing\nmechanisms that bring the cost of drugs down, and through grants that help the poorest countries\nto buy such medicines. The WHO has also been praised for its leadership during the 2003 SARS\nepidemic; within just four months, the disease had been contained.\nIn 2009, fears that the swine flu virus could mutate into a more lethal form prompted the WHO to\ndeclare its first ever Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC – see Box).\nGovernments rushed to stockpile vaccines, most of which were never used, as the epidemic turned\nout to be milder than expected. This 'disproportionate' response, as it was described in a 2011\nEuropean Parliament resolution, was blamed for wasting millions of euros of public money on\nunnecessary vaccines. Some critics even alleged that WHO decisions had been swayed by the\ninterests of the pharmaceutical sector. An internal enquiry exonerated the WHO from most of these\naccusations, arguing that, in view of the evidence available at the time, it would not have been\npossible to predict the course of the epidemic, while also acknowledging that the situation could\nhave been handled more transparently.\nWhereas the WHO was accused of over-reacting to swine flu, its response to the 2014 West African\nEbola outbreak came too late to prevent tens of thousands of deaths. In what international health\nexperts described as an 'egregious failure', the WHO waited months before declaring a PHEIC,\ndespite warnings, including from its own staff, that the epidemic was out of control. The\norganisation's lumbering bureaucratic response contrasted unfavourably with more agile\ninterventions by non-governmental bodies such as Médecins Sans Frontières. On the other hand, in\n2018 efforts to contain a second outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were\nmore successful, with just 33 deaths in total; for some observers, the organisation's quick response,\nwhich included the release of emergency funding just hours after the start of the outbreak and a\npersonal visit to Kinshasa by Director-General Tedros a few days later, suggested that it had learned\nlessons from its 2014 failures. Ebola remains a serious threat in West Africa; a subsequent outbreak\ntriggered another PHEIC, and killed over 2 000.\nNon-communicable diseases and other health threats\nWhile media attention tends to focus on emergencies caused by infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases such as cancer cost far more lives. However, the WHO's track record in this\nrespect is, again, a mixed one. For example, many recommendations issued by the International\nAgency for Research on Cancer, a semi-autonomous branch of the WHO, are scientifically sound;\nhowever, critics allege that the body does not do enough to prevent conflicts of interest that might\ninfluence expert assessments on which its recommendations are based, nor is it very successful at\ncommunicating its conclusions with the public.\nOn smoking, described by the WHO as a 'global epidemic', the main instrument is the 2003\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control, the first ever international treaty adopted within the\nWHO framework. The measures it envisages have played a key role in shaping national tobacco\ncontrol policies, including in developing countries. Implementation is still patchy, but gradually\nimproving: as of 2018, 12 % of the 181 countries which are parties to the Convention were failing to\nensure protection from passive smoking (e.g. bans on smoking in public places), 23 % were not\napplying packaging and labelling requirements (such as health warnings on cigarette packets), 29 %\ndid not have awareness-raising and educational measures in place, while 30 % were not restricting\ntobacco sales to and by minors. Tobacco still kills over 8 million people every year, most of them in\ndeveloping countries, and consumption is only declining slowly.\nObesity is another global health scourge that the WHO has taken on. For example, in 2016 it\nendorsed taxes on soft drinks as an effective means of reducing sugar consumption. However, it has\nrun into resistance from the beverages industry, and the US government, which in 2018 blocked a\nWHO panel from issuing a global recommendation on sugar taxes.\nIn developing countries, the high cost of medicines is often a barrier to effective treatment.\nImproving access to medicines has long been a priority for the WHO. The interests of producers,\nwhich are protected by patents, have to be balanced against patients' need for affordable treatment.\nHowever, WHO work in this area has been blocked by disagreements between countries which\nargue that intellectual property is not part of the organisation's remit – typically pharmaceutical\nexporters, such as the United States (US) – and others, including developing countries, which feel\nthat it should be.","full_prompt":"What are three failures of the WHO regarding fighting diseases and other health threats?\nOnly respond to the prompt using the information in the prompt.

Like the above-noted uses of AI to imitate Tom Hanks and George Carlin, the\nexamples below illustrate that some AI uses raise concerns under both ROP laws and myriad other laws.\nOne example of AI’s capability to imitate voices was an AI-generated song called “Heart on My Sleeve,”\nwhich sounded like it was sung by the artist Drake and was heard by millions of listeners in 2023.\nSimulating an artist’s voice in this manner could make one liable under ROP laws, although these laws\nCongressional Research Service 4\ndiffer as to whether they cover voice imitations or vocal styles as opposed to the artist’s actual voice.\nVoice imitations are not, however, prohibited by copyright laws. For example, the alleged copyright\nviolation that caused YouTube to remove “Heart on My Sleeve”—namely, that it sampled another\nrecording without permission—was unrelated to the Drake voice imitation. In August 2023, Google and\nUniversal Music were in discussions to license artists’ melodies and voices for AI-generated songs.\nThe potential for AI to replicate both voices and likenesses was also a point of contention in last year’s\nnegotiations for a collective bargaining agreement between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation\nof Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)—a union that represents movie, television, and radio\nactors—and television and movie studios, including streaming services. SAG-AFTRA expressed concern\nthat AI could be used to alter or replace actors’ performances without their permission, such as by using\nreal film recordings to train AI to create “digital replicas” of actors and voice actors. The Memorandum of\nAgreement between SAG-AFTRA and studios approved in December 2023 requires studios to obtain\n“clear and conspicuous” consent from an actor or background actor to create or use a digital replica of the\nactor or to digitally alter the actor’s performance, with certain exceptions. It also requires that the actor’s\nconsent for use of a digital replica or digital alterations be based on a “reasonably specific description” of\nthe intended use or alteration. The agreement provides that consent continues after the actor’s death\nunless “explicitly limited,” while consent for additional postmortem uses must be obtained from the\nactor’s authorized representative or—if a representative cannot be identified or located—from the union.\nIn January 2024, SAG-AFTRA announced it had also reached an agreement with a voice technology\ncompany regarding voice replicas for video games, while a negotiation to update SAG-AFTRA’s\nagreement with video game publishers is reportedly ongoing.\nCommentators have also raised concern with deceptive AI-generated or AI-altered content known as\n“deepfakes,” including some videos with sexually explicit content and others meant to denigrate public\nofficials. To the extent this content includes real people’s NIL and is used commercially, ROP laws might\nprovide a remedy. Where deepfakes are used to promote products or services—such as the AI replica of\nTom Hanks used in a dental plan ad—they may also constitute false endorsement under the Lanham Act.\nIn addition to these laws, some states have enacted laws prohibiting sexually explicit deepfakes, with\nCalifornia and New York giving victims a civil claim and Georgia and Virginia imposing criminal\nliability. In addition, Section 1309 of the federal Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of\n2022 (VAWA 2022) provides a civil claim for nonconsensual disclosure of “intimate visual depictions,”\nwhich might be interpreted to prohibit intimate deepfakes—as might some states’ “revenge porn” laws. A\nbill introduced in the House of Representatives in May 2023, the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate\nImages Act, H.R. 3106, would amend VAWA 2022 by creating a separate civil claim for disclosing certain\n“intimate digital depictions” without the written consent of the depicted individual, as well as providing\ncriminal liability for certain actual or threatened disclosures. Deepfakes may also give rise to liability\nunder state defamation laws where a party uses them to communicate reputation-damaging falsehoods\nabout a person with a requisite degree of fault.\nRegarding the use of AI in political advertisements, some proposed legislation would prohibit deepfakes\nor require disclaimers for them in federal campaigns, although such proposals may raise First Amendment\nconcerns. The Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, S. 2770 (118th Cong.), for instance, would ban\nthe use of AI to generate materially deceptive content falsely depicting federal candidates in political ads\nto influence federal elections, while excluding news, commentary, satires, and parodies from liability.\nGoogle announced that, as of mid-November 2023, verified election advertisers on its platform “must\nprominently disclose when their ads contain synthetic content that inauthentically depicts real or realisticlooking people or events.”\nAnother concern some commentators raise is that AI-generated material might be falsely attributed to real\npersons without their permission. One writer who focuses on the publishing industry, for instance, found\nthat books apparently generated by AI were being sold under her name on Amazon. Although the\nCongressional Research Service 5\ncompany ultimately removed these titles, the writer claimed that her “initial infringement claim with\nAmazon went nowhere,” since her name was not trademarked and the books did not infringe existing\ncopyrights. As she noted, however, this scenario might give rise to claims under state ROP laws as well as\nthe Lanham Act. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states that “books sold as if authored\nby humans but in fact reflecting the output of [AI]” violate the FTC Act and may result in civil fines.\nIt is unclear how Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 might apply when ROP-infringing\ncontent from a third party, including content made with AI, is disseminated through social media and\nother interactive computer services. Although the law generally bars any lawsuits that would hold online\nservice providers and users liable for third party content, there is an exception allowing lawsuits under\n“any law pertaining to intellectual property.” Courts differ as to whether state ROP laws and the Lanham\nAct’s prohibition on false endorsement are laws “pertaining to” IP within the meaning of Section 230.\nAnother Legal Sidebar discusses the application of Section 230 to generative AI more broadly.\nConsiderations for Congress\nSome commentators have called for federal ROP legislation to provide more uniform and predictable\nprotection for the ROP in the United States. Others have argued that Congress should leave ROP\nprotection to the states on federalism grounds. If Congress decides to craft federal ROP legislation, it\nmight consider the scope of the ROP protections it seeks to enact, the effect of those enactments on state\nROP laws, and constitutional authorities and limitations on Congress’s power to enact ROP protections.\nAs noted below, some Members have proposed legislation that would prohibit certain unauthorized uses\nof digital replicas or depictions of individuals while leaving state ROP laws in place.

Like the above-noted uses of AI to imitate Tom Hanks and George Carlin, the\nexamples below illustrate that some AI uses raise concerns under both ROP laws and myriad other laws.\nOne example of AI’s capability to imitate voices was an AI-generated song called “Heart on My Sleeve,”\nwhich sounded like it was sung by the artist Drake and was heard by millions of listeners in 2023.\nSimulating an artist’s voice in this manner could make one liable under ROP laws, although these laws\nCongressional Research Service 4\ndiffer as to whether they cover voice imitations or vocal styles as opposed to the artist’s actual voice.\nVoice imitations are not, however, prohibited by copyright laws. For example, the alleged copyright\nviolation that caused YouTube to remove “Heart on My Sleeve”—namely, that it sampled another\nrecording without permission—was unrelated to the Drake voice imitation. In August 2023, Google and\nUniversal Music were in discussions to license artists’ melodies and voices for AI-generated songs.\nThe potential for AI to replicate both voices and likenesses was also a point of contention in last year’s\nnegotiations for a collective bargaining agreement between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation\nof Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)—a union that represents movie, television, and radio\nactors—and television and movie studios, including streaming services. SAG-AFTRA expressed concern\nthat AI could be used to alter or replace actors’ performances without their permission, such as by using\nreal film recordings to train AI to create “digital replicas” of actors and voice actors. The Memorandum of\nAgreement between SAG-AFTRA and studios approved in December 2023 requires studios to obtain\n“clear and conspicuous” consent from an actor or background actor to create or use a digital replica of the\nactor or to digitally alter the actor’s performance, with certain exceptions. It also requires that the actor’s\nconsent for use of a digital replica or digital alterations be based on a “reasonably specific description” of\nthe intended use or alteration. The agreement provides that consent continues after the actor’s death\nunless “explicitly limited,” while consent for additional postmortem uses must be obtained from the\nactor’s authorized representative or—if a representative cannot be identified or located—from the union.\nIn January 2024, SAG-AFTRA announced it had also reached an agreement with a voice technology\ncompany regarding voice replicas for video games, while a negotiation to update SAG-AFTRA’s\nagreement with video game publishers is reportedly ongoing.\nCommentators have also raised concern with deceptive AI-generated or AI-altered content known as\n“deepfakes,” including some videos with sexually explicit content and others meant to denigrate public\nofficials. To the extent this content includes real people’s NIL and is used commercially, ROP laws might\nprovide a remedy. Where deepfakes are used to promote products or services—such as the AI replica of\nTom Hanks used in a dental plan ad—they may also constitute false endorsement under the Lanham Act.\nIn addition to these laws, some states have enacted laws prohibiting sexually explicit deepfakes, with\nCalifornia and New York giving victims a civil claim and Georgia and Virginia imposing criminal\nliability. In addition, Section 1309 of the federal Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of\n2022 (VAWA 2022) provides a civil claim for nonconsensual disclosure of “intimate visual depictions,”\nwhich might be interpreted to prohibit intimate deepfakes—as might some states’ “revenge porn” laws. A\nbill introduced in the House of Representatives in May 2023, the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate\nImages Act, H.R. 3106, would amend VAWA 2022 by creating a separate civil claim for disclosing certain\n“intimate digital depictions” without the written consent of the depicted individual, as well as providing\ncriminal liability for certain actual or threatened disclosures. Deepfakes may also give rise to liability\nunder state defamation laws where a party uses them to communicate reputation-damaging falsehoods\nabout a person with a requisite degree of fault.\nRegarding the use of AI in political advertisements, some proposed legislation would prohibit deepfakes\nor require disclaimers for them in federal campaigns, although such proposals may raise First Amendment\nconcerns. The Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, S. 2770 (118th Cong.), for instance, would ban\nthe use of AI to generate materially deceptive content falsely depicting federal candidates in political ads\nto influence federal elections, while excluding news, commentary, satires, and parodies from liability.\nGoogle announced that, as of mid-November 2023, verified election advertisers on its platform “must\nprominently disclose when their ads contain synthetic content that inauthentically depicts real or realisticlooking people or events.”\nAnother concern some commentators raise is that AI-generated material might be falsely attributed to real\npersons without their permission. One writer who focuses on the publishing industry, for instance, found\nthat books apparently generated by AI were being sold under her name on Amazon. Although the\nCongressional Research Service 5\ncompany ultimately removed these titles, the writer claimed that her “initial infringement claim with\nAmazon went nowhere,” since her name was not trademarked and the books did not infringe existing\ncopyrights. As she noted, however, this scenario might give rise to claims under state ROP laws as well as\nthe Lanham Act. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states that “books sold as if authored\nby humans but in fact reflecting the output of [AI]” violate the FTC Act and may result in civil fines.\nIt is unclear how Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 might apply when ROP-infringing\ncontent from a third party, including content made with AI, is disseminated through social media and\nother interactive computer services. Although the law generally bars any lawsuits that would hold online\nservice providers and users liable for third party content, there is an exception allowing lawsuits under\n“any law pertaining to intellectual property.” Courts differ as to whether state ROP laws and the Lanham\nAct’s prohibition on false endorsement are laws “pertaining to” IP within the meaning of Section 230.\nAnother Legal Sidebar discusses the application of Section 230 to generative AI more broadly.\nConsiderations for Congress\nSome commentators have called for federal ROP legislation to provide more uniform and predictable\nprotection for the ROP in the United States. Others have argued that Congress should leave ROP\nprotection to the states on federalism grounds. If Congress decides to craft federal ROP legislation, it\nmight consider the scope of the ROP protections it seeks to enact, the effect of those enactments on state\nROP laws, and constitutional authorities and limitations on Congress’s power to enact ROP protections.\nAs noted below, some Members have proposed legislation that would prohibit certain unauthorized uses\nof digital replicas or depictions of individuals while leaving state ROP laws in place.

These live services include extra content, subscription offerings and other revenue generated in addition to\nthe sale of our full games and free-to-play games. Our net revenue attributable to live services and other was $5,547 million,\n$5,489 million, and $4,998 million for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and we expect that live services net\nrevenue will continue to be material to our business. Within live services and other, net revenue attributable to extra content\nwas $4,463 million, $4,277 million, and $3,910 million for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Extra content net\nrevenue has increased as more players engage with our games and services, and purchase additional content designed to provide\nvalue to players and extend and enhance gameplay. Our most popular live services are the extra content purchased for the\nUltimate Team mode associated with our sports franchises, that allows players to collect current and former professional players\nin order to build and compete as a personalized team, and extra content purchased for our Apex Legends franchise.

In our industry, players increasingly purchase games digitally as opposed to purchasing physical\ndiscs. While this trend, as applied to our business, may not be linear due to a mix of products during a fiscal year, consumer\nbuying patterns and other factors, over time we expect players to purchase an increasingly higher proportion of our games\ndigitally. As a result, we expect net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads to increase over time and net revenue\nattributable to sales of packaged goods to decrease.\nOur net revenue attributable to digital full game downloads was $1,343 million, $1,262 million, and $1,282 million during\nfiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively; while our net revenue attributable to packaged goods sales was $672 million,\n$675 million, and $711 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In addition, as measured based on total units\nsold on Microsoft’s Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Sony’s PlayStation 4 and 5 rather than by net revenue, we estimate that\n73 percent, 68 percent, and 65 percent of our total units sold during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, were sold digitally.\nDigital full game units are based on sales information provided by Microsoft and Sony; packaged goods units sold through are\nestimated by obtaining data from significant retail and distribution partners in North America, Europe and Asia, and applying\ninternal sales estimates with respect to retail partners from which we do not obtain data. We believe that these percentages are\nreasonable estimates of the proportion of our games that are digitally downloaded in relation to our total number of units sold\nfor the applicable period of measurement.\nIncreases in consumer adoption of digital purchase of games combined with increases in our live services revenue generally\nresults in expansion of our gross margin, as costs associated with selling a game digitally is generally less than selling the same\ngame through traditional retail and distribution channels.\nIncreased Competition. Competition in our business is intense. Our competitors range from established interactive\nentertainment companies to emerging start-ups. In addition, the gaming, technology/internet, and entertainment industries are\nconverging, and we compete with large, diversified technology companies in those industries.

","context_document":"Nevertheless, there is still no AI that is\nequivalent or superior to human intelligence in all of its aspects2\n.\nIn the near future however, this vision might become reality. Technological progress will play\na key role as an enabler of modern AI systems: Computing power and memory size are estimated to\nmultiply by a thousand times over the next twenty to twenty-five years, facilitating the processing\nand storing of massive amounts of data3\n. Further developments in the field of artificial neural\nnetworks and deep learning techniques will result in systems that are less dependent on human\ninvolvement; improved sensor technology will make it easier for systems to interact with their\nenvironment4\n. The decreasing costs for AI technologies will further facilitate their pervasiveness.\nAlthough a big portion of AI research is working towards systems that have little to do with\ncreating a machine with human features, there are still advances in this field – for example, robot\nwoman Sophia who became a YouTube celebrity for stating in a 2016 interview that she wanted “to\ndestroy humans”5\n. While this seemed to be rather a marketing stunt, it is important to discuss the\neffects of humanoid and android robots.\nIn this essay, I want to take a closer look at the status quo of humanoid AI and the\nimplications this technology can have as an assistant, friend or even love interest to humans. I argue\nthat artificial intelligence will – once it becomes a realistic companion to humans – interrupt\nsocietal structures to some extent, leading to a growing amount of human-machine relationships.\n\n.\nTo pursue “real” AI, specialists in developmental robotics are now following a less abstract\npath than writing a programme for a computer11. Their theory is that a system that has an actual\nbody will be more likely to build a form of general intelligence because it can experience its\nsurroundings and match sensorial data with actions12. This branch of robotics is based on another\nhypothesis of Turing’s; in 1950, he claimed that an artificially intelligent system could be best\ncreated if it went through a phase that is similar to the childhood of other species 13\n.\nThe iCub robot was developed to investigate this theory. Having the weight and size of an\ninfant, it carries the spirit of Turing’s thought: Instead of pre-programming its skills and feeding it\nwith data, researchers teach it like a child to enable it to conceive its own solutions 14. Here, one\nquestion arises: How does a system develop the will to learn something? After all, it does not even\nhave a will by default. It was found that a strategy working for humans does the same trick for AI\nsystems too: a reward. The field of reinforcement learning derives from this method and has been\nalso applied to the iCub series15. This has enabled the robots to attain skills like picking up an item16\nor crawling on the floor17. These actions might not seem too complex for us at the first glance but\nthey do involve a number of obstacles the robot has to overcome. In the future, iCub could help us\nin the household by setting the table for dinner or preparing food.\nBut there is another interesting thing about iCub: its chubby face, big eyes, and LED-facial\nexpressions leave no doubt that it was made to bear a resemblance to real humans. Yet still, it is\nobvious to anybody that it is not an actual person. These features make iCub a so-called humanoid.\nRobots that are made to look exactly like humans on the other hand are called androids\nThe market is prepared for it: Looking at the increasing popularity of home assistants like\nAlexa or Google Assistant we can expect our reliance on technological devices to grow even\nstronger in the future. They might become more to us than just a personal weatherman or a direct\nconnection to our Amazon shopping basket: artificially intelligent programmes and robots could\neventually write Christmas cards to our friends and family, suggest the perfect birthday present for\nour partner or even take care of our children.\nIn fact, a robot nanny is not as far-fetched as one would expect: Robots like Pepper, iPal or\nKuri are programmed to be companions to children – they can recognize emotions in their faces,\nplay with them and let parents watch their offspring from afar through their built-in cameras 23. They\nmight not yet be an adequate substitute for an adult taking care, but manufacturers are definitely\nworking towards this goal. Regarding the high costs of childcare in many countries, they could soon\nbecome a very popular help in parenting – and real friends to a generation that grows up surrounded\nby technology. In Japanese schools, robots have already proven to be a successful addition. They\nare assisting students to focus better in class, add a welcome variety to subjects like history or show\nexercises in physical education24. The robot Robosem has been teaching English in South Korean\nclassrooms, as teachers in this subject are scarce25\n.\nNot only childcare can profit from the advances in AI and robotics: As a means of therapy,\nintelligent technology can be valuable in retirement homes. An example of this is the robot seal\nParo that has been successfully utilized in dementia therapy and as a companion to elderly people\nsince its introduction in 2001. The robot’s body is covered in fake fur and it is sensitive to touch,\nmoving and making seal-like noises when it is petted. It is used to calm patients, to encourage social\ninteractions and to give people that are reliant on help a chance to switch roles and become\ncaregivers themselves26. Once they become more elaborate, robots could be a way to meet the\nshortage of skilled workers in the field of elderly care especially in aging societies like Japan or\nGermany.\nEthical Implications of Human-Robot Relationships\nIn the light of the technological advances that will be made within the next years, the ethics of\nhuman-robot relationships must be discussed. The next generations will likely grow up surrounded\nby artificially intelligent machines and it is hard to say if and how this will affect their perceptions\nof interaction not only with robots but humans as well.\nA study conducted by ATR Intelligent Robotics and Communications and three Japanese\nuniversities revealed that children sometimes showed abusive behaviour towards robots – especially\nwhen they were in groups without any adults close by. In the study, the robot Robovie was\npatrolling a Japanese mall, asking people politely to step aside when somebody stood in its way; if\nthere was no reaction, the robot would move in the opposite direction. There were several situations\nhowever, where researchers observed that children were deliberately blocking the robot’s way,\nkicking it, throwing items at it and calling it names. As a consequence, the researchers developed an algorithm that let the robot recognize groups of children and avoid them33. This does not seem like a\nperfect solution to the problem, especially if we take the rising amount of robots in children’s rooms\ninto account. \nIt is hard to say to what extent robots will become a surrogate for genuine human affection in\nthe future but revisiting the comparison to smartphones made earlier, I believe that it is alarming\nthat people turn to machines in the search for human connection. In a society that is increasingly\nbuilt on perfectionist standards, I argue that artificially intelligent robots designed to be friends and\nlovers might become a threat for human relationships. If we hold our friends and partners to the\nsame standards that we will be used from robots in the future, we will be heavily disappointed.\n","full_prompt":"You are to answer questions based only on provided texts, without relying on any outside information.

While this seemed to be rather a marketing stunt, it is important to discuss the\neffects of humanoid and android robots.\nIn this essay, I want to take a closer look at the status quo of humanoid AI and the\nimplications this technology can have as an assistant, friend or even love interest to humans. I argue\nthat artificial intelligence will – once it becomes a realistic companion to humans – interrupt\nsocietal structures to some extent, leading to a growing amount of human-machine relationships.\n\n.\nTo pursue “real” AI, specialists in developmental robotics are now following a less abstract\npath than writing a programme for a computer11. Their theory is that a system that has an actual\nbody will be more likely to build a form of general intelligence because it can experience its\nsurroundings and match sensorial data with actions12. This branch of robotics is based on another\nhypothesis of Turing’s; in 1950, he claimed that an artificially intelligent system could be best\ncreated if it went through a phase that is similar to the childhood of other species 13\n.\nThe iCub robot was developed to investigate this theory. Having the weight and size of an\ninfant, it carries the spirit of Turing’s thought: Instead of pre-programming its skills and feeding it\nwith data, researchers teach it like a child to enable it to conceive its own solutions 14. Here, one\nquestion arises: How does a system develop the will to learn something? After all, it does not even\nhave a will by default. It was found that a strategy working for humans does the same trick for AI\nsystems too: a reward. The field of reinforcement learning derives from this method and has been\nalso applied to the iCub series15. This has enabled the robots to attain skills like picking up an item16\nor crawling on the floor17. These actions might not seem too complex for us at the first glance but\nthey do involve a number of obstacles the robot has to overcome. In the future, iCub could help us\nin the household by setting the table for dinner or preparing food.\nBut there is another interesting thing about iCub: its chubby face, big eyes, and LED-facial\nexpressions leave no doubt that it was made to bear a resemblance to real humans. Yet still, it is\nobvious to anybody that it is not an actual person. These features make iCub a so-called humanoid.\nRobots that are made to look exactly like humans on the other hand are called androids\nThe market is prepared for it: Looking at the increasing popularity of home assistants like\nAlexa or Google Assistant we can expect our reliance on technological devices to grow even\nstronger in the future. They might become more to us than just a personal weatherman or a direct\nconnection to our Amazon shopping basket: artificially intelligent programmes and robots could\neventually write Christmas cards to our friends and family, suggest the perfect birthday present for\nour partner or even take care of our children.\nIn fact, a robot nanny is not as far-fetched as one would expect: Robots like Pepper, iPal or\nKuri are programmed to be companions to children – they can recognize emotions in their faces,\nplay with them and let parents watch their offspring from afar through their built-in cameras 23. They\nmight not yet be an adequate substitute for an adult taking care, but manufacturers are definitely\nworking towards this goal. Regarding the high costs of childcare in many countries, they could soon\nbecome a very popular help in parenting – and real friends to a generation that grows up surrounded\nby technology. In Japanese schools, robots have already proven to be a successful addition. They\nare assisting students to focus better in class, add a welcome variety to subjects like history or show\nexercises in physical education24. The robot Robosem has been teaching English in South Korean\nclassrooms, as teachers in this subject are scarce25\n.\nNot only childcare can profit from the advances in AI and robotics: As a means of therapy,\nintelligent technology can be valuable in retirement homes. An example of this is the robot seal\nParo that has been successfully utilized in dementia therapy and as a companion to elderly people\nsince its introduction in 2001. The robot’s body is covered in fake fur and it is sensitive to touch,\nmoving and making seal-like noises when it is petted. It is used to calm patients, to encourage social\ninteractions and to give people that are reliant on help a chance to switch roles and become\ncaregivers themselves26. Once they become more elaborate, robots could be a way to meet the\nshortage of skilled workers in the field of elderly care especially in aging societies like Japan or\nGermany.\nEthical Implications of Human-Robot Relationships\nIn the light of the technological advances that will be made within the next years, the ethics of\nhuman-robot relationships must be discussed. The next generations will likely grow up surrounded\nby artificially intelligent machines and it is hard to say if and how this will affect their perceptions\nof interaction not only with robots but humans as well.\nA study conducted by ATR Intelligent Robotics and Communications and three Japanese\nuniversities revealed that children sometimes showed abusive behaviour towards robots – especially\nwhen they were in groups without any adults close by. In the study, the robot Robovie was\npatrolling a Japanese mall, asking people politely to step aside when somebody stood in its way; if\nthere was no reaction, the robot would move in the opposite direction. There were several situations\nhowever, where researchers observed that children were deliberately blocking the robot’s way,\nkicking it, throwing items at it and calling it names. As a consequence, the researchers developed an algorithm that let the robot recognize groups of children and avoid them33. This does not seem like a\nperfect solution to the problem, especially if we take the rising amount of robots in children’s rooms\ninto account. \nIt is hard to say to what extent robots will become a surrogate for genuine human affection in\nthe future but revisiting the comparison to smartphones made earlier, I believe that it is alarming\nthat people turn to machines in the search for human connection. In a society that is increasingly\nbuilt on perfectionist standards, I argue that artificially intelligent robots designed to be friends and\nlovers might become a threat for human relationships. If we hold our friends and partners to the\nsame standards that we will be used from robots in the future, we will be heavily disappointed.\n\nThis text discusses the advances leading toward having actual robot companions. Tell me the advances that have been made, the likely advances, and the limitations based on the text.

However, mild depressive symptoms are common in GAD.\nThe effectiveness of BuSpar in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not\nbeen demonstrated in controlled trials. There is no body of evidence available that\nsystematically addresses the appropriate duration of treatment for GAD. However, in a\nstudy of long-term use, 264 patients were treated with BuSpar for 1 year without ill effect.\nTherefore, the physician who elects to use BuSpar for extended periods should\nperiodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nBuSpar is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to buspirone hydrochloride.\nWARNINGS\nThe administration of BuSpar to a patient taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor\n(MAOI) may pose a hazard.

Therefore, before starting therapy with\nBuSpar, it is advisable to withdraw patients gradually, especially patients who have been\nusing a CNS-depressant drug chronically, from their prior treatment. Rebound or\nwithdrawal symptoms may occur over varying time periods, depending in part on the type\nof drug, and its effective half-life of elimination.\nThe syndrome of withdrawal from sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs can appear as any\ncombination of irritability, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, tremor, abdominal cramps,\nmuscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, flu-like symptoms without fever, and occasionally,\neven as seizures.\nPossible Concerns Related to Buspirone's Binding to Dopamine Receptors\nBecause buspirone can bind to central dopamine receptors, a question has been raised\nabout its potential to cause acute and chronic changes in dopamine-mediated neurological\nfunction (eg, dystonia, pseudo-parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia).

For example, real gross domestic product has been positive since the third quarter of 2022\nand grew by 1.4% and 2.8% in the first and second quarters of 2024, with real personal consumption expenditures up 1.5% and 2.3% over the same period. Real personal income less transfers grew in May\nand June 2024 and were up 1.8% over the year in June.\nThus far, the only indications of a weakening economy are coming from the labor market, and even there,\nindicators are inconsistent. Although there has been a 0.9 percentage point increase in the unemployment\nrate and nonfarm payroll employment growth has slowed, employment growth remained positive, which\nis inconsistent with a recession. (Recessions typically feature falling employment within the first three\nmonths.) Employment as measured by a different survey has shown some decreases, but the NBER does\nnot track this measure as closely.\nThe unemployment rate could be rising for reasons associated with a weakening economy (e.g., workers\nlosing their jobs) or for neutral reasons (e.g., new entrants to the labor force). Data on the reasons for\nunemployment suggest that the unemployment rate has risen at least partly because the economy has\nweakened. Almost two-thirds of the increase in unemployment in the past year has come from people who\nhave lost their jobs (mostly via temporary layoffs or jobs ending), whereas around one-third has come\nfrom people entering or reentering the labor force. On the other hand, the rise in unemployment has not\ncoincided with a rise in layoffs and discharges—which are still lower than during the expansion that\npreceded the pandemic—as would be expected if the economy were entering a recession. Additionally,\nmany economists assessed that the unemployment rate was unsustainably low for over two years. Some\ncooling in the labor market could indicate a rise to a more sustainable rate.

{"system_instruction":"You can only produce an answer using the context provided to you.","user_request":"Which batteries are in the early stages of commercialisation?\n","context_document":"Chapter 4: Batteries for Grid Applications\nOverview\nBatteries are devices that store energy chemically. This report focuses on “secondary” batteries,\nwhich must be charged before use and which can be discharged and recharged (cycled) many\ntimes before the end of their useful life. For electric power grid applications, there are four main\nbattery types of interest:\n Lead-acid\n High temperature “sodium-beta”\n Liquid electrolyte “flow” batteries\n Other emerging chemistries84\nLead-acid batteries have been used for more than a century in grid applications and in\nconventional vehicles for starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI). They continue to be the\ntechnology of choice for vehicle SLI applications due to their low cost. Consequently, they are\nmanufactured on a mass scale. In 2010, approximately 120 million lead-acid batteries were\nshipped in North America alone.85 Lead-acid batteries are commonly used by utilities to serve as\nuninterruptible power supplies in substations, and have been used at utility scale in several\ndemonstration projects to provide grid support.86 Use of lead acid batteries for grid applications is\nlimited by relatively short cycle life. R&D efforts are focused on improved cycle-life, which\ncould result in greater use in utility-scale applications.\nSodium-beta batteries include sodium-sulfur (NaS) units, first developed in the 1960s,87 and\ncommercially available from a single vendor (NGK Insulators, Ltd.) in Japan with over 270 MW\ndeployed worldwide.88 A NaS battery was first deployed in the United States in 2002.\n89 There are\nnow a number of U.S. demonstration projects, including several listed in Table 3. The focus of\nNaS deployments in the United States has been in electric distribution deferral projects, acting to\nreduce peak demand on distribution systems, but they also can serve multiple grid support\nservices. An alternative high-temperature battery, sodium-nickel-chloride, is in the early stages of commercialization.\n\n“Flow” batteries, in which a liquid electrolyte flows through a chemical cell to produce\nelectricity, are in the early stages of commercialization. In grid applications there has been some\ndeployment of two types of flow battery: vanadium redox and zinc-bromide. There are a number\nof international installations of vanadium redox units, including a 250 kW installation in the\nUnited States to relieve a congested transmission line.\n91 There are also a number of zinc-bromine\ndemonstration projects.92 Several other flow battery chemistries have been pursued or are under\ndevelopment, but are less mature.\nIn addition to the three battery types discussed above, there are several emerging technologies\nbased on new battery chemistries which may also have potential in grid applications. Several of\nthese emerging technologies are being supported by DOE efforts such as ARPA-E and are\ndiscussed briefly in the R&D section of this chapter.\n\nTechnology\nDescription and Performance\nLead-Acid\nThe lead-acid battery consists of a lead dioxide positive electrode (cathode), a lead negative\nelectrode (anode), and an aqueous sulfuric acid electrolyte which carries the charge between the\ntwo. During discharge, each electrode is converted to lead sulfate, consuming sulfuric acid from\nthe electrolyte. When recharging, the lead sulfate is converted back to sulfuric acid, leaving a layer of lead dioxide on the cathode and pure lead on the anode. In such conventional “wet”\n(flooded) cells, water in the electrolyte is broken down to hydrogen and oxygen during the\ncharging process. In a vented wet cell design, these gases escape into the atmosphere, requiring\nthe occasional addition of water to the system. In sealed wet cell designs, the loss of these gases is\nprevented and their conversion back to water is possible, reducing maintenance requirements.\nHowever, if the battery is overcharged or charged too quickly, the rate of gas generation can\nsurpass that of water recombination, which can cause an explosion.\nIn “valve regulated gel” designs, silica is added to the electrolyte to cause it to gel. In “absorbed\nglass mat” designs, the electrolyte is suspended in a fiberglass mat. The latter are sometimes\nreferred to as “dry” because the fiberglass mat is not completely saturated with acid and there is\nno excess liquid. Both designs operate under slight constant pressure. Both also eliminate the risk\nof electrolyte leakage and offer improved safety by using valves to regulate internal pressure due\nto gas build up, but at significantly higher cost than wet cells described above.93\nLead-acid is currently the lowest-cost battery chemistry on a dollar-per-kWh basis. However, it\nalso has relatively low specific energy (energy per unit mass) on the order of 35 Wh/kg and\nrelatively poor “cycle life,” which is the number of charge-discharge cycles it can provide before\nits capacity falls too far below a certain percentage (e.g., 80%) of its initial capacity. While the\nlow energy density of lead-acid will likely limit its use in transportation applications, increase in\ncycle life could make lead-acid cost-effective in grid applications.\nThe cycle life of lead-acid batteries is highly dependent on both the rate and depth of discharge\ndue to corrosion and material shedding off of electrode plates inside the battery. High depth of\ndischarge (DoD) operation intensifies both issues. At 100% DoD (discharging the battery\ncompletely) cycle life can be less than 100 full cycles for some lead-acid technologies. During\nhigh rate, partial state-of-charge operation, lead sulfate accumulation on the anode can be the\nprimary cause of degradation.

This report focuses on “secondary” batteries,\nwhich must be charged before use and which can be discharged and recharged (cycled) many\ntimes before the end of their useful life. For electric power grid applications, there are four main\nbattery types of interest:\n Lead-acid\n High temperature “sodium-beta”\n Liquid electrolyte “flow” batteries\n Other emerging chemistries84\nLead-acid batteries have been used for more than a century in grid applications and in\nconventional vehicles for starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI). They continue to be the\ntechnology of choice for vehicle SLI applications due to their low cost. Consequently, they are\nmanufactured on a mass scale. In 2010, approximately 120 million lead-acid batteries were\nshipped in North America alone.85 Lead-acid batteries are commonly used by utilities to serve as\nuninterruptible power supplies in substations, and have been used at utility scale in several\ndemonstration projects to provide grid support.86 Use of lead acid batteries for grid applications is\nlimited by relatively short cycle life. R&D efforts are focused on improved cycle-life, which\ncould result in greater use in utility-scale applications.\nSodium-beta batteries include sodium-sulfur (NaS) units, first developed in the 1960s,87 and\ncommercially available from a single vendor (NGK Insulators, Ltd.) in Japan with over 270 MW\ndeployed worldwide.88 A NaS battery was first deployed in the United States in 2002.\n89 There are\nnow a number of U.S. demonstration projects, including several listed in Table 3. The focus of\nNaS deployments in the United States has been in electric distribution deferral projects, acting to\nreduce peak demand on distribution systems, but they also can serve multiple grid support\nservices. An alternative high-temperature battery, sodium-nickel-chloride, is in the early stages of commercialization.\n\n“Flow” batteries, in which a liquid electrolyte flows through a chemical cell to produce\nelectricity, are in the early stages of commercialization. In grid applications there has been some\ndeployment of two types of flow battery: vanadium redox and zinc-bromide. There are a number\nof international installations of vanadium redox units, including a 250 kW installation in the\nUnited States to relieve a congested transmission line.\n91 There are also a number of zinc-bromine\ndemonstration projects.92 Several other flow battery chemistries have been pursued or are under\ndevelopment, but are less mature.\nIn addition to the three battery types discussed above, there are several emerging technologies\nbased on new battery chemistries which may also have potential in grid applications. Several of\nthese emerging technologies are being supported by DOE efforts such as ARPA-E and are\ndiscussed briefly in the R&D section of this chapter.\n\nTechnology\nDescription and Performance\nLead-Acid\nThe lead-acid battery consists of a lead dioxide positive electrode (cathode), a lead negative\nelectrode (anode), and an aqueous sulfuric acid electrolyte which carries the charge between the\ntwo. During discharge, each electrode is converted to lead sulfate, consuming sulfuric acid from\nthe electrolyte. When recharging, the lead sulfate is converted back to sulfuric acid, leaving a layer of lead dioxide on the cathode and pure lead on the anode. In such conventional “wet”\n(flooded) cells, water in the electrolyte is broken down to hydrogen and oxygen during the\ncharging process. In a vented wet cell design, these gases escape into the atmosphere, requiring\nthe occasional addition of water to the system. In sealed wet cell designs, the loss of these gases is\nprevented and their conversion back to water is possible, reducing maintenance requirements.\nHowever, if the battery is overcharged or charged too quickly, the rate of gas generation can\nsurpass that of water recombination, which can cause an explosion.\nIn “valve regulated gel” designs, silica is added to the electrolyte to cause it to gel. In “absorbed\nglass mat” designs, the electrolyte is suspended in a fiberglass mat. The latter are sometimes\nreferred to as “dry” because the fiberglass mat is not completely saturated with acid and there is\nno excess liquid. Both designs operate under slight constant pressure. Both also eliminate the risk\nof electrolyte leakage and offer improved safety by using valves to regulate internal pressure due\nto gas build up, but at significantly higher cost than wet cells described above.93\nLead-acid is currently the lowest-cost battery chemistry on a dollar-per-kWh basis. However, it\nalso has relatively low specific energy (energy per unit mass) on the order of 35 Wh/kg and\nrelatively poor “cycle life,” which is the number of charge-discharge cycles it can provide before\nits capacity falls too far below a certain percentage (e.g., 80%) of its initial capacity. While the\nlow energy density of lead-acid will likely limit its use in transportation applications, increase in\ncycle life could make lead-acid cost-effective in grid applications.\nThe cycle life of lead-acid batteries is highly dependent on both the rate and depth of discharge\ndue to corrosion and material shedding off of electrode plates inside the battery. High depth of\ndischarge (DoD) operation intensifies both issues. At 100% DoD (discharging the battery\ncompletely) cycle life can be less than 100 full cycles for some lead-acid technologies. During\nhigh rate, partial state-of-charge operation, lead sulfate accumulation on the anode can be the\nprimary cause of degradation. These processes are also sensitive to high temperature, where the\nrule of thumb is to reduce battery life by half for every 8°C (14°F) increase in temperature above\nambient.\n94 Manufacturers’ warrantees provide some indication of minimum performance\nexpectations, with service life of three to five years for deep cycle batteries, designed to be mostly\ndischarged time after time. SLI batteries in cars have expected service lives of five to seven years,\nwith up to 30 discharges per year depending on the rate of discharge. Temperature also affects\ncapacity, with a battery at -4°C (25°F) having between roughly 70% and 80% of the capacity of a\nbattery at 24°C (75°F).95\nFor many applications of lead-acid batteries, including SLI and uninterruptible power supply\n(UPS), efficiency of the batteries is relatively unimportant.

Frequently, the state’s\ngovernor is granted authority to designate an emergency during which the price limitations are in\nplace.\nFor example, the New York statute provides that:\nDuring any abnormal disruption of the market for consumer goods and services vital and\nnecessary for the health, safety and welfare of consumers, no party within the chain of\ndistribution of such consumer goods or services or both shall sell or offer to sell any such\ngoods or services or both for an amount which represents an unconscionably excessive\nprice.5\nThe statute defines abnormal disruption of the market as a real or threatened change to the market\n“resulting from stress of weather, convulsion of nature, failure or shortage of electric power or\nother source of energy, strike, civil disorder, war, military action, national or local emergency …\nwhich results in the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor.”6 The statute provides\nonly for criminal liability and leaves the ultimate decision as to whether a price is\n“unconscionably excessive” to prosecutors (for charging purposes) and to the courts, with no\nseparate cause of action created for private parties. As guidance in such cases, the statute notes\nthat if there is a “gross disparity” between the price during the disruption and the price prior to the\ndisruption, or if the price “grossly exceeds” the price at which the same or similar goods are\navailable in the area, such disparity will be considered prima facie evidence that a price is\nunconscionable.7\nSimilarly, Florida’s statute bars “unconscionable pricing” during declared states of emergency.8\nIf\nthe amount being charged represents a “gross disparity” from the average price at which the\nproduct or service was sold in the usual course of business (or available in the “trade area”)\nduring the 30 days immediately prior to a declaration of a state of emergency, it is considered\nprima facie evidence of “unconscionable pricing,” which constitutes an “unlawful act or\npractice.”\n9 However, pricing is not considered unconscionable if the increase is attributable to\nadditional costs incurred by the seller or is the result of national or international market trends.10\nAs with the New York statute, the Florida statute offers guidance, but the question of whether\ncertain prices during an emergency are deemed “unconscionable” is ultimately left to the courts.\nMany state price-gouging laws are triggered only by a declaration of emergency in response to\nlocalized conditions. Thus, they will generally not apply after a declared emergency ends or in\nareas not directly affected by a particular emergency or natural disaster. However, at least two\n\nGasoline Price Increases: Federal and State Authority to Limit “Price Gouging”\nCongressional Research Service 3\nstates have laws prohibiting excessive pricing that impose liability even without a declaration of\nany type of emergency.

The West Virginia statute provides that upon a\ndeclaration of a state of emergency by the President of the United States, the governor, or the\nstate legislature, it is unlawful to sell or offer to sell certain critical goods and services “for a price\ngreater than ten percent above the price charged by that person for those goods and services on\nthe tenth day immediately preceding the declaration of emergency.”\n16 West Virginia also provides\nan exception for price increases attributable to increased costs on the seller imposed by the\nsupplier or to added costs of providing the goods or services during the emergency.17\nSome states use language barring “unconscionable” or “excessive” pricing in a manner similar to\nthe state statutes described in the previous section but define these terms with hard caps instead of\nleaving their exact definition to the discretion of the courts. For example, the Alabama statute\nmakes it unlawful for anyone to “impose unconscionable prices for the sale or rental of any\ncommodity or rental facility during the period of a declared state of emergency.”\n18 However, it\nprovides that prima facie evidence of unconscionable pricing exists “if any person, during a state\nof emergency declared pursuant to the powers granted to the Governor, charges a price that\nexceeds, by an amount equal to or in excess of 25%, the average price at which the same or\nsimilar commodity or rental facility was obtainable in the affected area during the last 30 days\n\n\nGasoline Price Increases: Federal and State Authority to Limit “Price Gouging”\nCongressional Research Service 4\nimmediately prior to the declared state of emergency.”\n19 As with most other state price-gouging\nstatutes, the statute does not apply if the price increase is attributable to reasonable costs incurred\nby the seller in connection with the rental or sale of the commodity.20\nA few other states have imposed caps on price increases during emergencies even tighter than the\none imposed by the aforementioned statutes. Some state statutes ban any price increase during\nperiods of emergency. For example, in Georgia, it is considered an “unlawful, unfair and\ndeceptive trade practice” for anyone doing business in an areas where a state of emergency has\nbeen declared to\nsell or offer for sale at retail any goods or services identified by the Governor in the\ndeclaration of the state of emergency necessary to preserve, protect, or sustain the life,\nhealth, or safety of persons or their property at a price higher than the price at which such\ngoods were sold or offered for sale immediately prior to the declaration of a state of\nemergency.21\nAs with other state gouging statutes, the Georgia statute provides an exception for price increases\nthat reflect “an increase in cost of the goods or services to the person selling the goods or services\nor an increase in the cost of transporting the goods or services into the area.”\n\n","full_prompt":"This task requires you to answer questions based solely on the information provided in the prompt.

{"system_instruction":"Formulate your answer using only the provided text; do not draw from any outside sources.","user_request":"What is HR 4319?","context_document":"Background on the 2024 Farmworker Protection Rule\nDOL indicates that the purpose of the Farmworker Protection Rule is to strengthen “protections for\nagricultural workers,” enhance the agency’s “capabilities to monitor H-2A program compliance and take\nnecessary enforcement actions against program violators,” and ensure that “hiring H-2A workers does not\nadversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed workers” in the United States.\nThe rule amends existing regulations and includes provisions that encompass six areas: (1) “protections\nfor worker voice and empowerment,” (2) “clarification of termination for cause,” (3) “immediate effective\ndate for updated adverse effect wage rate,” (4) “enhanced transparency for job opportunity and foreign\nlabor recruitment,” (5) “enhanced transparency and protections for agricultural workers,” and (6)\n“enhanced integrity and enforcement capabilities.”\nIn the pending litigation, the first set of provisions, i.e., “protections for worker voice and empowerment”\nis most relevant. This set revises 20 C.F.R. § 655.135(h) and adds two new subsections, (m) and (n). DOL\nhas stated that these provisions aim to protect H-2A workers by “explicitly protecting certain activities all\nworkers must be able to engage in without fear of intimidation, threats, and other forms of retaliation”;\nsafeguarding “collective action and concerted activity for mutual aid and protection”; allowing workers to\ndecline to listen to “employer speech regarding protected activities without fear of retaliation”; permitting\nworkers to “designate a representative of their choosing in certain interviews”; and authorizing workers to\n“invite or accept guests to worker housing.” The rule states that it “does not require employers to\nrecognize labor organizations or to engage in any collective bargaining activities such as those that may\nbe required by the [National Labor Relations Act].” The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) is a law\nthat gives collective bargaining rights to workers who qualify as “employees” under the definition in the\nstatute. The NLRA explicitly excludes agricultural workers from the definition of “employee.”\nKansas v. U.S. Department of Labor\nOn June 10, 2024, Kansas and 16 other states, a trade association of growers, and a private farm filed a\ncomplaint against DOL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, arguing, among\nother things, that the Farmworker Protection Rule violates the NLRA because it gives H-2A agricultural\nworkers collective bargaining rights when the NLRA explicitly excludes agricultural workers from having\nthose rights. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary\nrestraining order seeking a stay of the effective date of the Farmworker Protection Rule or, in the\nalternative, a temporary restraining order until the court grants an injunction. The court held a hearing on\nthe motion on August 2, 2024, and on August 26, 2024, the federal district court judge granted the\nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\nPlaintiffs’ Arguments\nThe arguments below were raised in the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. This Sidebar does\nnot cover every argument the plaintiffs advanced.\nThe Rule Violates the NLRA\nThe plaintiffs argued that the rule is not in accordance with existing law and that DOL is providing\ncollective bargaining protection to H-2A workers. According to the plaintiffs, parts of the rule are almost\na direct copy of certain provisions in the NLRA, such as those regarding unfair labor practices and\nrepresentatives and elections. The plaintiffs acknowledged that the rule does not expressly declare that H2A workers have a right to unionize and collectively bargain, but they claim that the protections conferred\nby the rule effectively confer such rights in contravention of the NLRA.\nThe Rule Exceeds DOL’s Authority Under the INA\nThe plaintiffs also argued that DOL has very limited authority to issue regulations under 8 U.S.C. § 1188.\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs state that Section 1188(a), which is the part of the statute DOL relied on to\npromulgate the rule, is being misinterpreted by the agency. According to the plaintiffs, DOL is supposed\nto neutralize any adverse effects from an influx of H-2A workers and not necessarily take affirmative\nsteps to improve the working conditions for H-2A workers. In addition, according to the plaintiffs,\nSection 1188(a) does not explicitly give DOL rulemaking authority.\nThe plaintiffs filed this lawsuit before the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v.\nRaimondo, which overturned the Chevron doctrine. The Chevron doctrine directed courts to defer to an\nagency’s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutes the agency administers. The plaintiffs argued\nthat because Congress’s intent was clear in 8 U.S.C. § 1188, DOL was not entitled to Chevron deference.\nRelatedly, the plaintiffs pointed out that DOL relies on caselaw that existed before the Supreme Court\noverruled the Chevron doctrine rather than on the statute itself.\nDOL’s Arguments\nThe arguments below were raised in DOL’s response to the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.\nThis Sidebar does not cover every argument DOL advanced.\nThe Rule Does Not Violate the NLRA\nIn summary, DOL argued that the rule does not require employers to recognize unions or engage in\ncollective bargaining and is therefore not in violation of the NLRA. According to DOL, the rule expands\non existing H-2A anti-discrimination provisions, and individuals who fall outside the NLRA’s definition\nof “employee” can still be protected by other statutes and regulations. DOL states that the rule does just\nthat by granting protections to those not covered by the NLRA. Finally, DOL argues that the rule and the\nNLRA do not conflict with one another.\nThe Rule Is a Proper Exercise of DOL’s Statutory Obligation\nDOL responded to the plaintiffs’ argument that the rule exceeded its authority by stating that the INA\ngrants it rulemaking authority. DOL pointed out that provisions in 8 U.S.C. § 1188 expressly reference\nDOL regulations and that Congress authorized it to implement the mission of the statute through\nregulation. Further, DOL argued that H-2A workers will become more attractive to U.S. employers if they\nreceive fewer protections than U.S. workers and that this in turn will “adversely affect” U.S. workers. The\ngoal of the rule, according to DOL, is to place H-2A workers on similar footing as U.S. workers to prevent an adverse effect in the long run. Lastly, DOL maintained that it has historically understood the\n“adverse effect” requirement “as requiring parity between the terms and conditions of employment\nprovided to H-2A workers ... and as establishing a baseline ‘acceptable’ standard for working conditions\nbelow which [U.S. workers] would be adversely affected.”\nDOL filed its response after the Supreme Court announced the overruling of Chevron in Loper Bright\nEnterprises. Citing Loper Bright Enterprises in a footnote, DOL argued that the best reading of Section\n1188 was that Congress had delegated to DOL broad, discretionary authority to take action to prevent\nadverse effects to workers in the United States. The agency claimed that the rule is an appropriate\nexercise of this discretionary authority, including because the rule “ensures that agricultural employers\ncannot use the H-2A workforce to undermine workers in the United States who seek better wages and\nworking conditions.”","full_prompt":"Formulate your answer using only the provided text; do not draw from any outside sources.\n\nProvided text:\nThe Court’s Order on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction\nOn August 26, 2024, a federal district court judge granted the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary\ninjunction. The judge found that the plaintiffs met their burden to show that they were entitled to\npreliminary relief. First, the judge held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their\ncase. The judge initially determined that the rule falls within DOL’s rulemaking authority under 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1188 but found that the rule conflicts with the NLRA. Specifically, the judge stated that DOL had “not\nshown a consequential difference between the rights protected by the [rule] and those given to\nnonagricultural workers by the NLRA,” that the rule “creates a right not previously bestowed by\nCongress,” and that DOL failed to show that Congress intended to give agricultural workers a right to\nparticipate in collective bargaining. The judge further found that just because DOL has rulemaking\nauthority does not mean it can “create law or protect newly-created rights of agricultural workers.”\nTherefore, the court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim. The judge\nfurther held that the plaintiffs met their burden with regard to the other factors needed to support a\npreliminary injunction.\nThe judge also found that, although the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary relief, that relief should be\nnarrowly tailored and party-specific. According to the court, nationwide relief is generally disfavored, as\n“national uniformity is not a proper consideration,” and a nationwide injunction in this case is\nunwarranted. The judge determined that the court is able to provide a tailored preliminary injunction that\naddresses the plaintiffs’ harms and can offer relief “without issuing a nationwide injunction.” DOL filed a\nmotion for reconsideration of the scope of the judge’s order, but the motion was denied.\nConsiderations for Congress\nMembers of Congress have taken differing views on the Farmworker Protection Rule. Before the rule was\nfinalized, several Members of Congress wrote a letter in November 2023 to Acting DOL Secretary Su and\nDHS Secretary Mayorkas in support of the rule, stating that the rule represents an opportunity to improve\nworking conditions for H-2A workers and “improve enforcement capabilities of agencies against abusive\nemployers.” Following the rule’s publication in April 2024, Representative Scott Franklin introduced a\nresolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to rescind the rule, H.J. Res. 135. This\nresolution would prohibit DOL from any future similar rulemaking. He and the co-sponsors maintain that\nthe rule will increase costs for agricultural producers and allow H-2A workers to unionize.\nThere are other options if Congress chooses to respond to DOL’s Farmworker Protection Rule. First,\nCongress may consider amending the NLRA’s definition of “employee” to include agricultural workers,\nthereby allowing H-2A agricultural workers to receive collective bargaining rights. Alternatively,\nCongress could amend the NLRA and other laws to authorize or prohibit different labor requirements\ncontained in the Farmworker Protection Rule that are not expressly addressed under existing statutes.\nCongress could also consider making changes to the H-2A visa program itself. For example, the\nAffordable and Secure Food Act (S. 4069) in the 118th Congress would, among other things, reform the\nH-2A visa program by adding worker protections and by providing visas for year-round jobs. A similar\nbill, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2023 (H.R. 4319), has been introduced in the House\nduring this Congress. Earlier versions of this bill introduced in the 116th and 117th Congresses passed the\nHouse.\n\nWhat is HR 4319?","domain":"Legal","type":"Fact Finding","high_level_type":"Q&A","__index_level_0__":798}

You are not allowed to use any external resources or prior knowledge.","user_request":"What was the first circuits ruling on the United States v Evans?","context_document":"Funding Limitations on Medical Marijuana Prosecutions In each fiscal year since FY2015, Congress has included provisions in appropriations acts that prohibit DOJ from using appropriated funds to prevent certain states and territories and the District of Columbia from “implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.” The FY2024 provision lists 52 jurisdictions, including every U.S. jurisdiction that had legalized medical cannabis use at the time it was enacted. On its face, the appropriations rider bars DOJ from taking legal action against the states directly in order to prevent them from promulgating or enforcing medical marijuana laws. In addition, federal courts have interpreted the rider to prohibit certain federal prosecutions of private individuals or organizations that Congressional Research Service 3 produce, distribute, or possess marijuana in accordance with state medical marijuana laws. In those cases, criminal defendants have invoked the rider before trial, seeking either the dismissal of their indictments or injunctions barring prosecution. By contrast, courts have generally declined to apply the rider outside the context of initial criminal prosecutions. For instance, the Ninth Circuit has held that the provision does not “impact[ ] the ability of a federal district court to restrict the use of medical marijuana as a condition of probation.” In the 2016 case United States v. McIntosh, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered the circumstances in which the appropriations rider bars CSA prosecution of marijuana-related activities. The court held that the rider prohibits the federal government only from preventing the implementation of those specific rules of state law that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. DOJ does not prevent the implementation of [such rules] when it prosecutes individuals who engage in conduct unauthorized under state medical marijuana laws. Individuals who do not strictly comply with all state-law conditions regarding the use, distribution, possession, and cultivation of medical marijuana have engaged in conduct that is unauthorized, and prosecuting such individuals does not violate [the rider]. Relying on McIntosh, the Ninth Circuit has issued several decisions allowing federal prosecution of individuals who did not “strictly comply” with state medical marijuana laws, notwithstanding the appropriations rider, and several district courts have followed that reasoning. As one example, in United States v. Evans, the Ninth Circuit upheld the prosecution of two individuals involved in the production of medical marijuana who smoked marijuana as they processed plants for sale. Although state law permitted medical marijuana use by “qualifying patients,” the court concluded that the defendants failed to show they were qualifying patients, and thus they could be prosecuted because their personal marijuana use did not strictly comply with state medical marijuana law. In the 2022 case United States v. Bilodeau, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit also considered the scope of the appropriations rider. The defendants in Bilodeau were registered with the State of Maine to produce medical marijuana, but DOJ alleged that they distributed large quantities of marijuana to individuals who were not qualifying patients under Maine law, including recipients in other states. Following indictment for criminal CSA violations, the defendants sought to invoke the appropriations rider to bar their prosecutions. They argued that the rider “must be read to preclude the DOJ, under most circumstances, from prosecuting persons who possess state licenses to partake in medical marijuana activity.” DOJ instead urged the court to apply the Ninth Circuit’s standard, allowing prosecution unless the defendants could show that they acted in strict compliance with state medical marijuana laws. The First Circuit declined to adopt either of the proposed tests. As an initial matter, the court agreed with the Ninth Circuit that the rider means “DOJ may not spend funds to bring prosecutions if doing so prevents a state from giving practical effect to its medical marijuana laws.” However, the panel declined to adopt the Ninth Circuit’s holding that the rider bars prosecution only in cases where defendants strictly complied with state law. The court noted that the text of the rider does not explicitly require strict compliance with state law and that, given the complexity of state marijuana regulations, “the potential for technical noncompliance [with state law] is real enough that no person through any reasonable effort could always assure strict compliance.” Thus, the First Circuit concluded that requiring strict compliance with state law would likely chill state-legal medical marijuana activities and prevent the states from giving effect to their medical marijuana laws. On the other hand, the court also rejected the defendants’ more expansive reading of the rider, reasoning that “Congress surely did not intend for the rider to provide a safe harbor to all caregivers with facially valid documents without regard for blatantly illegitimate activity.” Ultimately, while the First Circuit held that the rider bars CSA prosecution in at least some cases where the defendant has committed minor technical violations of state medical marijuana laws, it declined to Congressional Research Service 4 “fully define [the] precise boundaries” of its alternative standard. On the record before it, the court concluded that “the defendants’ cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana aimed at supplying persons whom no defendant ever thought were qualifying patients under Maine law” and that a CSA conviction in those circumstances would not “prevent Maine’s medical marijuana laws from having their intended practical effect.” Considerations for Congress It remains to be seen whether and how the difference in reasoning between the Ninth Circuit and the First Circuit will make a practical difference in federal marijuana prosecutions. In theory, the First Circuit’s analysis could make it easier for defendants to invoke the appropriations rider to bar federal prosecutions, because they could do so even if they had not been in strict compliance with state law. In practice, however, resource limitations and enforcement priorities have historically meant that federal marijuana prosecutions target only individuals and organizations that have clearly not complied with state law. Thus, one of the First Circuit judges who considered Bilodeau agreed with the panel’s interpretation of the rider but wrote a concurrence noting that, in practice, the First Circuit’s standard might not be “materially different from the one that the Ninth Circuit applied.” While the medical marijuana appropriations rider restricts DOJ’s ability to bring some marijuana prosecutions, its effect is limited in several ways. First, marijuana-related activities that fall outside the scope of the appropriations rider remain subject to prosecution under the CSA. By its terms, the rider applies only to state laws related to medical marijuana; it does not bar prosecution of any activities related to recreational marijuana, even if those activities are permitted under state law. Second, as the Ninth Circuit has explained, even where the rider does apply, it “does not provide immunity from prosecution for federal marijuana offenses”—it simply restricts DOJ’s ability to expend funds to enforce federal law for as long as it remains in effect. If Congress instead opted to repeal the rider or allow it to lapse, DOJ would be able to prosecute future CSA violations as well as past violations that occurred while the rider was in effect, subject to the applicable statute of limitations. Third, participants in the cannabis industry may face numerous collateral consequences arising from the federal prohibition of marijuana in areas including bankruptcy, taxation, and immigration. Many of those legal consequences attach regardless of whether a person is charged with or convicted of a CSA offense, meaning the rider would not affect them. Because the medical marijuana appropriations rider applies to marijuana specifically, regardless of how the substance is classified under the CSA, rescheduling marijuana would not affect the rider. Congress has the authority to enact legislation to clarify or alter the scope of the appropriations rider, repeal the rider, or decline to include it in future appropriations laws. For instance, Congress could amend the rider to specify whether strict compliance with state medical marijuana law is required in order to bar prosecution under the CSA or provide a different standard that DOJ and the courts should apply. Beyond the appropriations context, Congress could also consider other changes to federal marijuana law that would affect its interaction with state law. Such changes could take the form of more stringent marijuana regulation—for instance, through increased DOJ funding to prosecute CSA violations or limiting federal funds for states that legalize marijuana. In contrast, most recent proposals before Congress seek to relax federal restrictions on marijuana or mitigate the disparity between federal and state marijuana regulation.","full_prompt":"System Instructions: [This task requires you to answer questions based solely on the information provided in the prompt and context block. You are not allowed to use any external resources or prior knowledge.]\nQuestion: [What was the first circuits ruling on the United States v Evans?]\n\nContext Block: [Funding Limitations on Medical Marijuana Prosecutions In each fiscal year since FY2015, Congress has included provisions in appropriations acts that prohibit DOJ from using appropriated funds to prevent certain states and territories and the District of Columbia from “implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.” The FY2024 provision lists 52 jurisdictions, including every U.S. jurisdiction that had legalized medical cannabis use at the time it was enacted. On its face, the appropriations rider bars DOJ from taking legal action against the states directly in order to prevent them from promulgating or enforcing medical marijuana laws. In addition, federal courts have interpreted the rider to prohibit certain federal prosecutions of private individuals or organizations that Congressional Research Service 3 produce, distribute, or possess marijuana in accordance with state medical marijuana laws. In those cases, criminal defendants have invoked the rider before trial, seeking either the dismissal of their indictments or injunctions barring prosecution. By contrast, courts have generally declined to apply the rider outside the context of initial criminal prosecutions. For instance, the Ninth Circuit has held that the provision does not “impact[ ] the ability of a federal district court to restrict the use of medical marijuana as a condition of probation.” In the 2016 case United States v. McIntosh, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered the circumstances in which the appropriations rider bars CSA prosecution of marijuana-related activities. The court held that the rider prohibits the federal government only from preventing the implementation of those specific rules of state law that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. DOJ does not prevent the implementation of [such rules] when it prosecutes individuals who engage in conduct unauthorized under state medical marijuana laws. Individuals who do not strictly comply with all state-law conditions regarding the use, distribution, possession, and cultivation of medical marijuana have engaged in conduct that is unauthorized, and prosecuting such individuals does not violate [the rider]. Relying on McIntosh, the Ninth Circuit has issued several decisions allowing federal prosecution of individuals who did not “strictly comply” with state medical marijuana laws, notwithstanding the appropriations rider, and several district courts have followed that reasoning. As one example, in United States v. Evans, the Ninth Circuit upheld the prosecution of two individuals involved in the production of medical marijuana who smoked marijuana as they processed plants for sale. Although state law permitted medical marijuana use by “qualifying patients,” the court concluded that the defendants failed to show they were qualifying patients, and thus they could be prosecuted because their personal marijuana use did not strictly comply with state medical marijuana law.
