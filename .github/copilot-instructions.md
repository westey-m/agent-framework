# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Microsoft Agent Framework - a multi-language framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents.

## Repository Structure

- `python/` - Python implementation → see [python/AGENTS.md](../python/AGENTS.md)
- `dotnet/` - C#/.NET implementation → see [dotnet/AGENTS.md](../dotnet/AGENTS.md)
- `docs/` - Design documents and architectural decision records

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs in `docs/decisions/` capture significant design decisions and their rationale. They document considered alternatives, trade-offs, and the reasoning behind choices.

**Templates:**
- `adr-template.md` - Full template with detailed sections
- `adr-short-template.md` - Abbreviated template for simpler decisions

When proposing architectural changes, create an ADR to capture options considered and the decision rationale. See [docs/decisions/README.md](../docs/decisions/README.md) for the full process.
