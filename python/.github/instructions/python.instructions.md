See [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for project structure, commands, and conventions.

Additional guidance:
- Review existing tests and samples to understand coding style before creating new ones
- When verifying logic, run only related tests, not the entire suite
- Resolve all errors and warnings before running code
- Use print statements for debugging, then remove them when done
