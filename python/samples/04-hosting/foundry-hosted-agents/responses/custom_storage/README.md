# Custom session storage (Responses protocol)

This sample implements custom **MAF agent-session persistence**, including user
and sandbox isolation and optimistic concurrency. The outer Responses store and
function-approval store remain host-managed. This is not a workflow example.

## Identity and storage keys

For hosted requests, `FoundryRequestScope.from_context(config, platform_context)`
requires the platform-configured sandbox ID and trusted user/call IDs. A request
whose `agent_session_id` differs from `FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID` fails closed.
The provider resolves this scope **before** creating a backend client.

The Cosmos partition key is `/scope_key`: the same bounded, framed hash of
**trusted user + sandbox** used by the default hosted store. Each item ID hashes
the host's response/conversation lookup key inside that partition. Changing the
call ID does not change the namespace. Changing either the user or the sandbox
does. No raw platform IDs or tokens are written into document keys or logs.

The storage key is not `AgentSession.session_id`. A host may save one MAF
snapshot under a response ID and a conversation ID; each key has its own ETag.
The snapshot's inner `session_id` is preserved when loading. Keys are not built
from caller model options or an inner model-service session ID.

Cosmos items have a 2 MB service limit. Before a create or replacement, this
sample checks the complete compact, escaped-JSON snapshot against a conservative
**2,000,000-byte budget**, leaving room for service metadata. Oversized state
fails explicitly before a backend write; a service 413 also becomes an
actionable size error. Reduce the state or start a new conversation instead of
retrying an oversized snapshot. This per-item check is not a retention policy
or aggregate storage quota; those remain tracked in
microsoft/agent-framework#8901.

**Existing unscoped data is not migrated.** The old `/user_id` container layout
and connection-string configuration are intentionally replaced. Use a new
container partitioned by `/scope_key` and start fresh conversations; do not fall
back to user-only documents or silently copy old snapshots.

## Conditional writes and deletes

Each request receives a new store view with its own per-key ETags; only the
Cosmos client/pool is shared. A loaded snapshot is replaced with
`MatchConditions.IfNotModified` and the **loaded ETag**. A missing or never-loaded
key is **create-only**, never an unconditional upsert. Successful writes refresh
that key's ETag without changing another key's token.

HTTP 409/412 conflicts raise an explicit error. Reload and reconsider the turn;
do not retry the stale write as an unconditional update. A delete also uses the
loaded ETag (loading first if necessary), so it cannot remove another request's
newer snapshot. An absent delete is idempotent. Missing ETags and mismatched
stored scope fail closed; other Cosmos failures propagate without a local
fallback.

Local runs use isolated in-memory snapshots with the same conditional behavior.
They are lost when the process exits and are **single-user development only**:
local headers/session selectors are not a trusted platform authentication
boundary. Explicit local sessions have separate namespaces.

## Cosmos prerequisites

Create the database/container separately and set:

```text
AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.documents.azure.com:443/
COSMOS_DATABASE_NAME=<database>
COSMOS_CONTAINER_NAME=<container-with-partition-key-/scope_key>
```

The hosted provider uses `azure.identity.aio.ManagedIdentityCredential`, with
the platform-provided `FOUNDRY_AGENT_INSTANCE_CLIENT_ID` when present. Grant that
managed identity **Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor** at the narrowest
applicable container scope using Cosmos **data-plane RBAC**, not an account
management role. No Cosmos account key, connection string, password or raw
credential is deployed. The container is not provisioned by `main.py`.

The model also requires access to the configured Foundry project. Local model
calls use `AzureCliCredential` (`az login`); they do not require Cosmos.

## Run

Set `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`, then follow
the [parent local-host instructions](../../README.md#running-the-agent-host-locally).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":"Hi"}'
```

The host uses `history_source="agent_server"` and a request-owned agent/client
factory. It reconstructs history from the outer transcript rather than retaining
it on Python instances or enabling inner model storage. Outer `store=false`
does not access/write this custom session store.

For hosted use, configure the endpoint/database/container in the manifest and
follow the [parent deployment instructions](../../README.md#deploying-the-agent-to-foundry).
The provider closes the Cosmos client and its own credential at shutdown;
request clients are closed after their request, including failed tool entry and
cancellation.

Live Cosmos access and deployment need separately approved resources and
permissions.
